FASTER RESULTS- Your past experiences don't matter. Even if you're brand new to this, you'll still see progress in just 8 minutes.- You don't need to focus hard on your breathing or be in a certain pose. All you need is to sit down, close your eyes, plug in your earphones, and start listening. We'll take care of the rest.HYPNOTELLING: OUR SECRET WEAPONWe like to believe we make all our decisions rationally, but that's not exactly true. Most of the time, we're driven by emotions we don't fully understand or can't entirely control.Luckily, your subconscious mind can give you all the things you need. You just need to speak its language - images, sensations etc.Your subconscious mind is like a monkey: it doesn't understand words, but it understands visual information, and remembers emotions. Once you understand this, you can tune it to your liking. Voice allows you to connect to your subconscious mind. It teaches, it heals, it helps to calm down and regain your strength.For example, it won't only help you deal with anxiety, sleep problems, or burnout, but will also help get to the root of your problems and the reason behind their symptoms, so you can feel calm, inspired, and motivated again.You become the main character of an exciting adventure story. It's sort of like embarking on a psychological quest in a dreamlike state. You move through a story, face challenges along the way, and learn how to tackle them.Unlike meditation, our stories help keep your brain alert and conscious. It enters a trance-like state where it absorbs information more effectively, giving you faster results. The closest thing it can be compared to is affirmations. You'll notice relaxation and motivation as quick as 8 minutes story.BASED ON RESEARCH-BACKED TECHNIQUESHypnotelling is based on a method that has been used for athlete training, supportive therapy, psychotherapy, and for scientific research.HYPNOTELLING EFFECTIVELY HELPS- lower anxiety and stress levels- get you to sleep faster without meditation, and improve your sleeping habits- boost your energy- increase self-motivation- improve mental healthMeditation help you develop mindfulness, but it's a slow and difficult process that can be hard to navigate on your own. Voice is like meditation 2.0: it not only allows you to expand your consciousness, but also helps you apply this experience and take action today, tomorrow, and forever. And the best thing is, you'll acquire beneficial mental skills that will stay with you for the rest of your life!EMBARK ON YOUR ADVENTURE WITH VOICE TODAYSend your suggestions and questions to help@voice-stories.appUser terms and conditions: https://voice-stories.app/#popup-terms",https://voice-journey.app,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.voicestories.android&hl=en&gl=US,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/av6nj_oyNGELhSWdvU9Krl6y7qAy4kwDUlcqJCyA7LYm7ZADPKs2y4gX9TQK4AU05A=w240-h480-rw,4.0.62,26-10-2021,01-10-2025,0.275,03-10-2025

The treatment includes Focus Score, a first-of-its-kind personalized metric where you can track attention progress.EndeavorOTC is for adults 18 years and older with ADHD experiencing inattention-related challenges that affect their quality of life such as diminished focus, inability to complete projects or tasks, keep track of important items, and more. Built with the same technology as EndeavorRx, the world's first FDA-authorized video game treatment. EndeavorOTC is available now by subscription. No prescription needed. EndeavorOTC was studied in more than 220 participants over a 6-week period. In the clinical trial, 88% of participants saw improvement in their attention and 73% of participants reported quality of life improvements, including an increased ability to balance projects, get things done on time and keep track of important items like phone, wallet, and keys. There were no lasting or serious side effects in any clinical trials for EndeavorOTC. (1,2)How EndeavorOTC improves focus: The gameplay challenges you to tap targets and navigate obstacles to boost your attention and focus. As you progress through the game, the technology is continuously measuring your performance and using adaptive algorithms to adjust the difficulty and personalize the treatment experience.How to Play EndeavorOTC: Playing EndeavorOTC can fit into your daily routine. The more you play, the better your results.Playing the game every day for an initial six weeks can improve your attention and other functions that make up your ability to focus. Users will be given a target Focus Score increase which should be achievable in six weeks. Based on clinical trial data, the target increase provided directly relates to improvement in ADHD-related symptoms and overall quality of life. And, for the vast majority of people, this will leave room for continued improvement in Focus Score and cognitive abilities as well as ADHD symptom management beyond the initial six week course of treatment. It is recommended that patients speak to their health care provider before starting EndeavorOTC treatment, and before making any medical decisions. © 2025 Akili Interactive Labs, Inc.

Set up a habit2. Tell HabitBull how you went for a day3. Watch your daily streak increaseHabits are no more than routines which you perform subconsciously. To build one - train yourself. To break one, find another one which is similar, yet different and nicer, and repeat it until it sticks.To assist you with this HabitBull lets you set reminders for each habit and displays them on days when you need to be successful. This is especially useful if you have a to do list with repeating tasks or if you want to be reminded to do the same thing every day. It can also be used as a calendar planning tool or checklist, but also as a very effective repeating reminder (e.g. to drink water every 2 hours).HabitBull does feel a little like a game in which you compete with yourself. The task is to get a long streak for the habit you are working on by covering your goals. The longer the better. It takes a couple of months to fully build a new routine, so don't give up - it takes time and if you are consistent it will work; even if it takes a few attempts.There are many things which you may want to improve. HabitBull can be used as a planner in building habits like taking your pills regularly, exercise, or keep to a diet. It can also be used as a helper for people suffering from memory problems. As for your vices, HabitBull can be a useful goal tracking tool, or a smart notebook, to assist you while breaking bad habits like nail-biting, drinking alcohol and even improving your dating skills.It is entirely up to you, really.

This is achieved through pineal gland stimulation using brainwave entrainment music. The result of elevated consciousness is an increase in our natural extrasensory abilities. With elevated consciousness, awareness, creativity, extrasensory perception, and intuition are all increased. The third eye serves as the connection to all knowledge and endless creativity. The pineal gland is stimulated through the use of isochronic modulation which is the most advanced form of brainwave entrainment. Through brainwave entrainment, elevated states of delta, alpha, theta, beta or gamma wave are increased and the mind is placed into the proper meditative state. With daily Pinealwave meditation the third eye will be opened and consciousness will be elevated. The power and potential of meditation being used to activate the pineal gland has been known and used by many cultures throughout the history of mankind.  THE POWER OF THIRD EYE OPENINGThe concept of the third eye is a spiritual and philosophical one that is found in various cultures and belief systems around the world. It is often associated with the pineal gland, which is a small gland in the brain that is believed to regulate the body's circadian rhythms.  Here are some of the potential benefits that are associated with opening the third eye:Increased intuition: Opening the third eye is said to enhance your ability to perceive and understand subtle energies and to trust your intuition.Clarity of mind: By activating the third eye, you may experience greater mental clarity and focus, as well as an improved ability to concentrate and retain information.Spiritual insight: Third eye awakening can lead to deeper understanding of spiritual concepts and experiences, including meditation, mindfulness, and yoga.Enhanced creativity: By opening the third eye, you may experience greater inspiration and creativity, as well as an increased ability to access your imagination.Improved health: Some people believe that opening the third eye can improve physical health by regulating the body's internal rhythms and promoting overall balance and harmony.This app includes all 7 chakra meditations audio and 3 special categories;1.

If you can't keep track of what you're supposed to be doing, this app is not for you. The app includes tracking of projects so you know how much time you spent working on each of your clients/books/websites/whatever - like a time sheet, but it's not meant to be an organizer or a to-do list.- This app is in English only. No translations are planned for the foreseeable future.- This app will not let you pause work sessions or finish them early, so if you have a tiny baby-sized bladder and you need to pause every few minutes, this app is not for you. The shortest work session you can set is 10 minutes and you're not supposed to be interrupted. Also because I use this app too, and I'd be the first to abuse that pause feature to go look up useless nonsense instead of getting work done.- The purpose of this app is not to promote a healthy work-life balance, but to get you to work harder.

Unlike an AI therapist, a mood tracker or a journal app, Betwixt takes you on a guided immersive adventure deep into the mysteries of your own mind. On this epic inner journey, you’ll reconnect with your wisest self and unlock a whole range of psychological powers:• Improve your emotional intelligence, self care and coping skills• Calm your nerves and soothe overwhelming feelings• Uncover new paths to self improvement, self actualization and growth• Tap into your subconscious mind through the power of story• Identify your values to increase your motivation, sense of gratitude and life purpose  • Deepen your self knowledge to help you in overcoming sadness, resentment, low self esteem, fixed mindset, negative perception, insecurities.💡 WHAT MAKES BETWIXT WORKBetwixt is a relaxing, de-stressing game that draws on decades of psychology research and therapeutic practice into how we feel, think and behave. It includes tools for emotion regulation and self reflection, journal prompts for mental health, elements of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), mindfulness approaches, Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), Jungian theory and others. Together, these methods work to improve your wellbeing, calm your mind, increase your self esteem and help you deal with challenging emotions. ◆ An immersive experienceIn Betwixt, you become the hero (or heroine) of an interactive adventure through a dreamlike world that responds to your thoughts and feelings. We’ve used immersive storytelling and sounds to create an alternative for people who find a CBT diary too dry, and struggle to engage with mindfulness, breathing or counseling apps, emotion trackers and mood journals. For neurodivergent users, Betwixt stands out among ADHD apps for adults by offering a  creative, engaging approach that removes distractions, improves your focus, motivation and mindset without creating digital addiction.◆ Evidence-basedIndependent psychology research shows that Betwixt can significantly reduce anxiety, stress and depression, with effects that can last months.

Increasing your productivity. Improving your daily routine.That and more is what you can do with TimeTune, your schedule planner and time blocking app.👍 RECOMMENDED BY EXPERTSJessica McCabe from “How to ADHD” recommends TimeTune as an ideal tool to build solid routines and give structure to your day.😀 WHAT IS TIMETUNE?TimeTune is a schedule planner and time blocking app. Use it to organize your agenda, plan routines and increase your productivity.Do you know why some people can get plenty of things done in a single day while your time slips through your fingers?The answer is that they have a very structured distribution of time. They organize their agenda with a planner and have strong time management habits. That allows them to seize the day and complete their tasks.With TimeTune Schedule Planner you can do the same.👩‍🔧 HOW DOES IT WORK?TimeTune uses time blocks to build your agenda. Just add time blocks to your day or use time blocks to build templates that can be reused at any time, like a morning routine or a timetable.Templates allow you to plan upcoming schedules, routines, timetables or work shifts in a flash. You will enjoy an automated agenda.TimeTune Schedule Planner also shows you statistics to see where the time goes. Check them to see if your time is correctly structured and how you can improve.You can add custom reminders to your time blocks, so you don’t forget your agenda: reminders with custom vibrations, custom sounds, voice, etc (ideal if you have ADHD).With TimeTune Schedule Planner you can create a time management system as simple or as complex as you need. This daily planner will allow you to finally complete your tasks and save time.🤓 WHY DOES IT WORK?Time blocking is a scheduling method that divides your day into smaller segments of time for specific tasks. If you add statistics, you get the perfect time management system to optimize your productivity.A structured day increases focus and motivation. Time blocking on a daily planner allows you to concentrate on the task at hand and avoid distractions.As Cal Newport, author of “Deep Work” states:“Time blocking generates a massive amount of productivity. A 40-hour time-blocked work week produces the same amount of output as a 60+ hour work week without structure”It’s no wonder high achievers like Benjamin Franklin, Bill Gates and many others embraced this planning method and used a daily planner to organize their agenda in a structured way.Also, for people with ADHD, time blocking can be a crucial approach to tackle their agenda and avoid anxiety. If you have ADHD, TimeTune Schedule Planner allows you to focus on each task, improve your daily routine and see where the time actually goes.🤔 WHAT CAN I DO WITH TIMETUNE?With TimeTune Schedule Planner you can:★ Increase your focus and productivity★ Organize your agenda and reach your goals★ Improve your time management skills★ Plan your daily routine★ Set routines, timetables and work shifts★ Have a structured agenda★ Use it as your daily planner and routine planner★ Remove routine tasks from other calendars★ Analyze your time and discover time leaks★ Add custom reminders (ideal for ADHD)★ Free up time for yourself★ Organize your life with a better work/life balance★ Avoid anxiety and burnout★ Do everything in your agenda★ Do tasks in time if you have ADHD🙋 WHO IS IT FOR?If you would like to do more things with your time, TimeTune Schedule Planner is for you.Users with ADHD also tell us that TimeTune helps them a lot with their schedule and use the app as their routine manager. If you have ADHD, try TimeTune and let us know what you think.Thank you very much! 🥰",https://timetune.app,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmail.jmartindev.timetune&hl=en&gl=US,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/L3qZUcWIbdU1zlg8TO2pT4s4lKrl7YIuikaaD1pAE82iqCIlP21CAnwB8385iXGdgSw=w240-h480-rw,5.1,30-09-2014,24-09-2025,1.0,03-10-2025

Daily affirmations help rewire our brains, build self-esteem, and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.Positive affirmations help make major shifts in your mindset, and they also serve as prompts and daily reminders about what you’re truly capable of, ensuring every day is an amazing day.An affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your conscious and unconscious mind. The more you strengthen this connection, the more resilient you’ll be when you experience difficult or challenging circumstances.As Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe. And the best way to strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.There are many benefits to using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words, making it easier to recognize the negative and self-doubting thought patterns holding you back.- Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want, like achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting, and good, you’re creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen.- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on its head.

We've developed an accessible and effective GRAMMAR COURSE for all-level learners.  English grammar can be confusing and overwhelming. Good news: we've done all the hard work for you. We took the most essential and relevant grammar and broke it down into bite-sized topics complete with drills. Each topic is a simple rule or structure, which comes with an instant comprehension check. With this system you can learn English grammar from the basics, all by yourself.2.We've created an improved FLASHCARD LIBRARY for more effective word learning. Each flashcard has a sentence which helps memorize the word using associations. The app uses spaced repetition to help you remember every word. Expand your vocabulary fast with Simpler. 3. At Simpler we know the importance of listening skills and learning the correct pronunciation from the very beginning. That's why every phrase in our exercises is voiced by a native speaker. And in our PRACTICE section you can put new grammar and vocabulary to use and role play one of the two speakers in a real-life dialogue.  4. DRILLS are one of the key elements of our course. These are grammar exercises, such as completing a sentence or typing in the translation of a phrase. The drills train you to formulate correct sentences and use new grammar without even thinking about it. Some of the previously learned grammar is regularly added to your drills to keep your memory strong. We use various types of exercises in our drills to maximize the efficiency and make them fun. 5.

Whenever you want to make progress towards your goals, plant a seed in Flora. As you work hard, the seed will grow into a healthy tree. Let the tree be your coach and grow yourself with it. You will be amazed by how great you can be.

FOCUS TREES

Have trouble putting down the phone? Flora blocks distracting apps in a pleasant way to help you focus on what’s more important in real life. If you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app while growing a tree, the tree will be killed! But if succeeding, you'll unlock new trees.

DOUBLE EFFICIENCY WITH FRIENDS 

Things get even more interesting when you challenge your friends to plant trees together—you will see who kills a tree (ouch). However, if you successfully stay away from your phones together, each of you will win an additional tree from a random friend. You can also chat and share your progress to motivate each other and keep everyone on track.*

* Flora is the original app for multi-user tree planting and delivers the best features that help you and your friends be productive. 

TO-DO LIST & WIDGET

Flora is a to-do list, and more. Simply create a to-do item and set a reminder, then you will never forget a thing. Even better, you can tag your trees with a to-do item to easily track the progress towards each of your life goals. No matter if your goal is daily, weekly, or monthly, Flora will help you follow it through and achieve it.

HABIT TRACKER

Enjoy a rewarding daily habit routine. If you grow trees regularly, you will earn yourself a beautiful, vibrant garden. Take a look at it and feel proud of yourself! Each tree records your perseverance and a step towards a healthy life. You can also view the daily, weekly, or monthly statistics of your activities in Flora to find opportunities to improve your time-management and planning skills.

REAL TREES, REAL IMPACT

Why not plant REAL trees while improving yourself? Flora proudly offers the opt-in Price and Care services that let you plant real trees on the earth if you kill or successfully grow a tree in the app. We partner with tree-planting organizations in Africa and East Asia, such as the Trees.org and Eden Reforestation Projects, to plant fast-growing soil rebuilding trees, fruit trees that diversify incomes and nutrition, and trees that can provide forage and fuel-wood. All these trees help make the earth greener and provide long-term financial aid to families who need it most.

Exocus is a unique focus timer app. Here, your focus is no longer boring, repetitive, or meaningless because every moment of your focus will transform your very own planet.

Do you struggle with staying motivated when you commit to doing something valuable in the long run, like learning new words, practicing an instrument, working out, or mastering a new language? Initially, you're full of enthusiasm, but soon, your passion wanes. Memorizing words becomes a chore, the instrument is neglected, workouts turn into a burden, and progress in the new language stalls...
You start doubting yourself: “Maybe I just don’t have what it takes to stick with long-term commitments.”

That’s not true! Let us explain the real reasons.

● Lack of Immediate Rewards:
You understand the long-term value of these tasks, but how much does this half-hour of focus matter right now?

● Repetition Leads to Boredom:
When the initial novelty wears off, the repetitive nature of the task can make you feel bored and tired.

● Overly Negative Focus: 
Focusing on what you haven't accomplished rather than acknowledging what you have done can lead to negative self-evaluation and loss of motivation.

Let Exocus Help You!


====== Exocus Solutions ======

Exocus is a gamified focus timer that visualizes your concentration as a planet's evolution, helping you achieve long-term, pain-free focus.

● Emotional Design and Sense of Meaning
After each focus session, you’ll see the story of what happened to your planet during that time. Even five minutes of focus equals 38.53 million years of evolution for your planet, so your focus is crucial. Want to raise the stakes? You can enable “Hardcore Mode,” where failing to focus might cause your planet to be destroyed!

● Stage-Based Incentives
Short-term Incentives: After each focus session, the planet’s landscape changes and tells you its story.
Medium-term Incentives: After several hours of focus, the planet undergoes more significant transformations, like forming magma, oceans, and land.
Long-term Incentives: After around ten hours of focus, the planet completes its evolution. You can then add it to your star system, with each project corresponding to a star system, showcasing your long-term accumulation in that project.

● Continuous Freshness
We offer hundreds of unique planet designs, satisfying your curiosity and desire to collect with constant surprises. See a planet's full appearance only after evolving it through focused efforts. Earn Stardust coins by focusing to unlock new planet seeds, motivating continuous concentration.


====== What Makes Exocus Special? ======

● Meticulously Crafted Design
Exocus uses a unique pixel art style, maintaining simplicity while incorporating delightful little Easter eggs for you to discover. We believe the beauty of Exocus can bring joy, which will ultimately translate into more focused time.

● Fun Game Elements
Exocus embraces gamified design in a bold yet restrained and professional manner. We hope the game elements help you enjoy focusing, and we also care deeply about your ability to truly focus. We’ve eliminated anything that could distract you because we genuinely want to focus on achieving long-term goals with you.

● Flexible Focus Modes
Exocus supports countdown timers, stopwatch mode, and the Pomodoro technique. In the Pomodoro technique, you can flexibly set focus and break durations and specify longer breaks after several focus cycles.

● Convenient Project Management
Each project corresponds to a planet. You can track different categories of focus time with projects and quickly switch between projects on the home screen by swiping left or right.

● Personalized Statistics
Based on your focus data, we provide personalized charts to help you understand your focus patterns and stay motivated to maintain consistent focus.

Have you tried a digital detox? And it did not work, because you fall back into your habits immediately? 

Well here is the solution:

one sec solves our unhealthy phone relationship at its roots: by making distracting apps less appealing, our brains lose interest to open them all the time without proper intention.

The effectiveness of one sec has been confirmed in a peer-reviewed scientific study with the Max-Planck Institute and Heidelberg University: app usage drops by 57% on average! Long-term!

Fight the social media algorithms and win back control over your phone usage & your subconsciousness!

“one sec” uses Shortcuts Automation to toggle a deep breath animation whenever you open one of the configured apps (Instagram, Twitter, YouTube…). This breaks unconcious social media habits short-term (literally, as soon as you have set it up) and even helps long-term by adding more friction when opening these apps.

Did you really want to open Instagram? Or was it just because you're bored waiting for your bus?
This app helps you to reflect your actions, thoughts, and feelings; disrupting harmful social media habits with mindfulness.

On top of that, “one sec” also contributes your mindful moments to the Health App via HealthKit.

Especially for people with ADHD one sec is a great tool to gain back control for incredible focus and concentration.

Integrations and collabs:
- You can set up one sec to sync tasks with Structured, so you won't be able to access social media apps during ongoing unfinished tasks.
- You can set up one sec to learn a new language with LENGO, so every time you open social media, you have to answer a handful of vocabularies.

Available Subscription Options:
one sec pro (annual / monthly / lifetime unlock)

BETTER THAN BINAURAL BEATS
Binaural beats and isochronic tones also use brainwave entrainment, but brain.fm does it better. We use patented A.I. on top of human-composed music to help you find your flow faster than binaural beats or other brainwave entrainment audio.

—— Features of “Focus Tomato” ——

Based on the Pomodoro method with new spice-ups and improvements.

* Do not force stop; keep the flow
Classical Promodoro clock asks you to stop working asap when time is up; Focus Tomato only notifies you with sound and does not force you to stop. You can keep staying in the zone and running the timer.

* Fractional time is allowed
Classical Promodoro clock requires to maintain 25 minutes duration. Focus Tomato freely lets you count the fractional time as long as it starts running.

* Modifiable Timeline
It is usual to forget to stop the timer. Focus Tomato allows you to modify the Timeline and make adjustments afterward.

* Do Not Disturb mode is available
Distracted by too many notifications? Do Not Disturb mode can be enabled when Focus Tomato is running.

* Integrate smoothly with other work methods and/or apps
Because the app only applies the timing part of the Promodoro technique, in addition to the original Promodoro method, you can also use the Reminder, Trello, or physical notebooks along with it.

This method is backed by productivity experts as one of the most effective ways to focus.

Features:
• Write down your 3 daily priorities
• Start and pause tasks anytime (Pomodoro-style)
• Track time spent on each task
• Clean, distraction-free interface
• No clutter, no bloat—just one simple screen
• Pleasant Tic-Tac sound to stay engaged
• One-time purchase. No subscriptions.

Why it works:
When you can only do three things per day, you start choosing what’s truly important. That focus leads to massive productivity gains without burnout.

Our story:
After trying every productivity app out there, we realized what we really needed didn’t exist: an app that forces focus on just 3 tasks a day. So we built it.

Privacy & Trust:
We never track you, never collect your data, and never run ads.

A BETTER EVERYDAY TIMER
I dreamt of a timer I could use every day that would simplify time and make the most of every moment it counted.

Inspired by the simple egg timer, Timer more honestly represents time as a single dimension. No hours or seconds—just minutes. There's nowhere to get lost. Scroll to set. Tap to start. Get back to life.

STOPWATCH & OVERSHOOT
When time expires, it doesn't stop at 0. Timer flips and begins to count up. This turns out to be pretty useful if you missed the alarm and don't know how much time has elapsed or if you cook and just need another minute without the hassle of setting another timer. Or scroll down to 0, tap, and it becomes a stopwatch ready to measure any length of time.

PLAYS LIKE A GAME, WORKS LIKE AN APP
Next generation user interface designed and built in 3D with animation and sounds inspired by video games. 

BIG & READABLE
Time you can read from across the room. Optional setting to keep your screen on during countdowns.

SKINS
Skins change the whole look and feel of the app. New skins and collaborations every season so you can keep it fresh.

WIDGETS
Drop a custom timer on your home screen for fast, one tap access to daily timers for coffee brewing, workouts, and other daily routines.

- Counting study time
The app counts.
Select a subject, set the study time, and count to record study time.
If you close the app or perform other operations while studying, the count will be interrupted.

- Register subjects
By registering subjects, you can record which subjects you studied.
By recording each subject, you can understand which subjects you do not have enough study time.

- Study history
Displays daily study time in a stacked bar graph.
Recheck your study time by looking at your past history.
If you do not have enough study time, make sure to set aside time for studying.

- Advertisement
This app is free to use, but ads are displayed.
To avoid interrupting your studies, ads are displayed only after the countdown is completed so as not to break your concentration.

- Purpose of this app

It helps you to form and keep track of your intentional habits, provides valuable insights for your decisions, and offers support in staying attentive.

### Personal Habits
If you're just starting out with one or two habits or already have a long list of things you want to keep track of — HabitBoard imposes no limitations on the types of habits you can track. The Free version allows for tracking of 3 habits, Pro supports unlimited habits.

### Historic Data
It provides a detailed calendar-like view of your historic data which grows over time. In addition, you get habit-specific statistics like current and longest streaks, completion rate, and count by week, month, and year.

### Statistics
HabitBoard provides meaningful and beautiful stats that give an overview over all your tracked habits. You can inspect your overall weekly and monthly completions, get an overall completion rate, and keep track of your daily completions. Available with HabitBoard Pro.

### Weekly Goals and Skipped Days
Some habits are not planned daily and HabitBoard makes it easy to configure automatically skipped days and weekly goals per habit. If you set a weekly goal, you'll see an additional label for the current progress in the habit list.

### Notes
You can add notes to individual days and review them for each habit. This can come handy to, e.g., remember why you marked a day as skipped, to keep track of when you start a new book with your reading habit, or take note when you start a new progression in your exercise habit.

### Customizable Colors
Each habit can use colors according to your personal taste or for visual grouping of habits. You can customize both the colors for done and missed habit states. Available with HabitBoard Pro.

### Widgets
HabitBoard offers Lock Screen widgets, a daily completions widget, and small, medium, and a large calendar-like widgets (which are interactive on iOS 17) so that you can glance on your habits even if you're not using the app.

### Shortcuts
With the “Mark habit as done” and “Set note for habit” Shortcuts actions, you can combine different tasks to automatically keep your HabitBoard up-to-date.

### Archived Habits
Some things also come to an end (or are paused), so HabitBoard offers a dedicated place for archived habits. Habits that live there are still fully interactive, so it can also be used as a more private area for certain habits. Available with HabitBoard Pro.

### Configuration of List Labels
Streaks are not always the most meaningful metric — sometimes it's better to focus more on completions. With HabitBoard, you can decide whether you want to display the current streak, weekly, monthly, and yearly completions in addition to the names in the habit list.

### Reminders
When you’re starting out, a daily reminder can be useful. If you want, the app notifies you when it’s time to review your HabitBoard for the day.
In addition, with HabitBoard Pro, each habit can have its own reminders. You can choose the time and weekdays where you want to be reminded, customize the notification message, and decide whether to be reminded if you already marked the habit for the day. And you can have multiple reminders per habit.

### Automatic Backup and Sync
HabitBoard securely and privately backups and syncs your habits via iCloud. If you're using a second device, your data is already there.

### Support for Apple Watch
If you’re using an Apple Watch, you can track your daily habits from your wrist. The dedicated watch app allows for marking habits directly (which is synced with the paired iPhone) and provides various complications for your watch face to display daily progress.

SCIENCE-BACKED METHOD TO BUILD BETTER HABITS
Most habit trackers fail. They try to motivate you with games like streaks and trophies only to turn on you when you fall off. Building habits doesn’t have to be miserable.

60 REPETITIONS
Studies show that a new behavior needs to be repeated 60 times for it to stick. It doesn’t matter if you miss a day or break a streak. It just matters that you do it 60 times. Great habit builders learn to ignore the goal and falling in love with the journey.

WE’RE YOUR GUIDE
Every day we will help you take another step and guide you along your journey to reach 60 repetitions until you’ve mastered your new habit.

NO GUILT. NO STREAKS. NO PHONY REWARDS.
If you miss a day or two, we don’t guilt you.

JUST GOOD FUN VIBES.
Every step forward is progress. 

WHAT SMALL THING YOU COULD YOU DO TO IMPROVE YOUR LIFE?
Works for any habit: meditate, walk, stretch, floss, read, journal, draw, keep in touch with family, or less time on screens.

WIDGETS & REMINDERS TO STAY MOTIVATED
Track your habits on your home screen for easy access.

SKINS TO CUSTOMIZE
Skins change the whole look and feel of the app. New skins and artist collaborations released occasionally.

» Features
•  Track multiple habits, repeated to do's or goals, each in its own calendar
•  Streak counter and percentage successful for each habit
•  Yes/No or Number goals
•  Very flexible goals like: number of times per day/week/month, only on certain days of the week etc. For example: 30 push ups every Mon-Fri, go to the gym 2 times per week, or even every 2 days
•  Inspiring quotes per category - including actual quotes from people doing it (meditation, reading, stop drinking alcohol, stop smoking cigarettes, stop procrastination etc)
•  Graphs with success percentage / streak, entered values etc
•  Powerful reminders - multiple times per day, sound and vibrate optional
•  Multi-device syncing
•  Cloud backup
•  Discussion Forums
•  Pin Lock

» How it works:
1. Set up a habit
2. Tell HabitBull how you went for a day
3. Watch your daily streak increase

Habits are no more than routines which you perform subconsciously. To build one - train yourself. To break one, find another one which is similar, yet different and nicer, and repeat it until it sticks.

To assist you with this HabitBull lets you set reminders for each habit and displays them on days when you need to be successful. This is especially useful if you have a to do list with repeating tasks or if you want to be reminded to do the same thing every day. It can also be used as a calendar planning tool or checklist, but also as a very effective repeating reminder (e.g. to drink water every 2 hours).

HabitBull does feel a little like a game in which you compete with yourself. The task is to get a long streak for the habit you are working on by covering your goals. The longer the better. It takes a couple of months to fully build a new routine, so don't give up - it takes time and if you are consistent it will work; even if it takes a few attempts.

• Stand – it will surprise you when you learn just how much of your day you spend sitting down. Your attention will improve, you will feel more energised, and you will improve your physical health by getting into one simple habit – standing up frequently and regularly.

• Squats – your partner will love this habit and so will you. Your muscles will become firmer and more toned, and you will feel stronger. Squats can even help you lose weight.

• Eat healthily – everyone knows the benefits of eating healthily. Getting into a regular and committed healthy eating habit is easier said than done, however. HabitMinder is the solution – it will help keep your healthy eating plans on track.

With 1Blocker, you’re safe online and nothing will distract you from enjoying sites.

1Blocker is very easy to use — just flip a couple of switches to start blocking ads and trackers. The app will automatically receive cloud updates to the built-in filters silently, so you don’t need to do anything. It’s as simple as setting and forgetting.

1Blocker is a fully native app designed to extend Safari naturally. It’s lightweight and doesn’t drain your battery by taking up your device’s resources.

The blocking itself is super fast because Safari does it itself. We only provide filters to Safari and don’t modify webpages in any way. This vastly improves efficiency because Safari knows in advance what should be blocked. So, with 1Blocker, sites load on average 2-5x faster.

It’s important to note that not all ads can be blocked though. Some sites use techniques that make it impossible for us to block their ads using currently available features for Safari content blockers.

SECURE BY DESIGN

1Blocker is secure and private. It doesn’t have access to webpages and doesn’t track you in any way.

We believe that privacy is not for sale. That's why we don't have an ""Acceptable Ads"" program. We stay independent, and the only way we make money is through direct sales of 1Blocker in the App Store to you.

ADVANCED CUSTOMIZATION

1Blocker is a highly customizable content blocker, providing the possibility to create powerful custom rules. It allows you to create custom rules that block any URL by providing a regular expression or hide any element by CSS. It also lets you block cookies. (Available in Premium)

AVAILABLE ON ALL DEVICES

1Blocker is available for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Your preferences and custom rules are always in sync through iCloud no matter which device you're using.

FEATURED IN THE PRESS

1Blocker has been featured in TechCrunch, Lifehacker, MacStories, Macworld, and many more.

FEATURES AVAILABLE FOR FREE

• The ability to enable one category (for example, Block Ads only)
• Whitelisting sites right from the Safari extension
• Whitelist synchronization between devices via iCloud

FRIENDLY SUPPORT

“I’d recommend Hush to anyone who uses Safari”
— John Gruber, Daring Fireball

SECURE AND PRIVATE

Hush doesn't have any third party dependencies, behavioral tracking nor crash reporting – no data is collected and nothing leaves your device. 

The blocking is done by Safari itself with instructions from Hush, so the app has no access to your browser habits nor does it want to. Don't take our word for it – we play with open cards and publish the source code for anyone to inspect. 

SIMPLE YET POWERFUL

Using Hush is as easy as installing it and enabling it in Settings -> Apps -> Safari -> Extensions. No settings, no maintenance – just thousands of rules doing the hard work for you in the background. 

It works like magic – you will not notice Hush until you disable it. 

MODERN, TINY AND FAST

The app is primarily a host of rules that integrates with Safari in a native lightweight way, making the blocking efficient, fast and easy on your disk space.

FREE AND OPEN

Hush is both free of charge and Open Source with a permissive MIT license. No in-app purchases, no nonsense.

It pairs a physical tag with a powerful app to block the noise — and give you your time back.

With a single tap, you enter Monk Mode. Apps you’ve chosen get blocked. Focus kicks in. Need something more intense? Activate Deep Focus — during that time, not even your NFC tag can unlock your phone. Want total lockdown? Turn on Strict Mode to make the app undeletable and your setup unbreakable.

Whether you’re working, studying, or just trying to be present, Monk creates an environment where focus thrives.

Key Features:
	•	Tap your Monk to block/unblock distractions
	•	Customizable app groups for different modes
	•	Weekly & daily focus stats
	•	Scheduled blocks via Apple Shortcuts (e.g. “when I arrive at the library”)
	•	Remote blocking — lock down your phone from anywhere
	•	Emergency unblocks (you get 3 — use them wisely)
	•	Strict Mode: makes the app undeletable while active
	•	Optional setup for a completely unbreakable experience

Websites in Safari will look clean, load fast, and stop invisibly tracking you. You’ll notice significant improvements to your battery life and data usage. Setup is a snap.

Wipr’s blocklist is updated twice a week automatically, and has enhanced versions for the following languages: Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Macedonian, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Thai, and Vietnamese.

Wipr 2 is a universal app: install it on all your devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Vision Pro) with a single purchase. It’s fully accessible with VoiceOver, Voice Control, and more. Dark and Tinted icon variants are included. Family Sharing is supported.

Because it’s developed by a single independent developer and 100% funded by its users, Wipr only answers to you: no one can pay to have their ads unblocked, and there are no “acceptable ads”.

This app was made with love and patience. I hope you’ll enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed designing and building it.

Set time limits, block apps during bedtime, reward them for chores and more.
Kids who have a smartphone spend an average of 7.5 hours on their devices per day. Screen Time was developed to help parents get their children to put their phones down and engage in outdoor activities, family chats at the dinner table, concentrate on their homework, and get a good night’s sleep.

The free version of Screen Time arms parents with information about their children's’ smartphone and tablet usage. With the free version of our screen time tracker, you are able to:

▪ Monitor your kids’ screen time
▪ View app usage - See which apps are being used and for how long
▪ Receive a notification when your kids try to install a new app
▪ Receive a daily summary of your kids app and web usage

If you decide you need to proactively manage your children's’ screen time on iPhone or iPad, our Premium version of our app gives parents greater control over their kids’ devices. 

With Screen Time Premium, you can:

▪ Set a specific daily time limit for your kids’ screen time
▪ Set schedules of when they can and can’t use their device
▪ Instantly pause your kids’ devices at the push of a button
▪ Block certain app activity during bedtime
▪ See exactly where your children are with GPS phone location tracking
▪ Get an alert when your child arrives or leaves a specific location
▪ Receive a daily email summary of your kids app and web usage

▪ Use Free Play mode to temporarily override time limit settings, like during long trips
▪ Share app management with other adults in your kids’ lives
▪ Have up to 5 devices per account, so you can track multiple kids and devices

Inscreen helps you pause and reflect on your screen time at regular intervals throughout the day. Designed for simplicity and privacy, Inscreen has minimal features and a zero learning curve, helping you get started quickly.

⏵ HOW IS INSCREEN DIFFERENT?

Unlike other screen time apps that completely block access, Inscreen draws on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) to help you recognize your screen time habits through regular prompts and inculcate healthier behaviours without restrictions.

⏵ WHY IT WORKS?

We tap into a few key psychological principles and behavioural patterns. Here’s why it works:
- Awareness = Better Choices: Regular reminders to ask whether you're on your phone intentionally, encouraging healthier choices.
- Guiding, not controlling: Instead of strict limits, scheduled subtle nudges to guide you toward mindful decisions, without the frustration of restrictions.
- Accountability: Weekly progress, actionable insights and daily notifications leading to lasting behaviour changes.
- Low barrier to entry: No drastic changes or restrictions, making it easy to integrate into daily life and gradually adjust over time.

⏵ FEATURES

- Alerts to be intentional about your screen time.
- Focus sessions to completely block distracting apps for a set routine, say, during work or winding down at night.
- Strict daily limits to keep your screen time in control.
- Notifications that help you track your daily activity.
- Secure and private. All your data stays on your device.

⏵ HOW DOES THE SETUP WORK?

1. Choose the distracting apps or categories.
2. Set a daily limit.
3. Set up focus sessions (optional).

Every family’s relationship with technology is unique, so we built tools for you to choose the right balance for your family, and help them create healthy digital habits. You can use the app to see how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings, and more.


With Family Link, you can:

Establish digital ground rules
• Set screen time limits — Find the screen time that works best for your child. Family Link lets you set daily time limits, with school time and downtime schedules for their devices, so you can help your child find a healthy balance.
• Manage your child’s apps — Give your child the flexibility they need when it comes to app usage. Set individual app time limits, and unlimited time for educational or regularly used apps. You can block apps, too.

Manage content filters and security & privacy
• Manage what they see online — Set up parental controls on Google services like Chrome, Play, YouTube, and Search. Family Link allows you to block inappropriate sites, require approval for new apps, manage permissions for apps and websites, and more.
• Secure their account — Family Link gives you access to manage your child’s account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child’s password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel necessary.*

*Children over the applicable age can manage their own account.

Stay connected on the go
• See where they are — It’s helpful to be able to find your family when they’re on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they’re carrying their device.
• Get notifications and alerts — Family Link delivers critical notifications including when your child arrives or leaves a certain location.  You can also ring devices and view the device’s remaining battery life.


Important Information

• Family Link’s tools vary depending on your child’s device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/
• While Family Link helps you manage your child’s purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will apply only when your child makes a purchase through Google Play’s billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternate billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.
• You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.
• To see the location of your child or teen’s device, the device must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet through data or wifi.
• Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome, and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.
• While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the internet safe. Family Link can not determine the content on the internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device, and determine what path to online safety looks best for your family.",http://families.google.com/familylink,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-family-link/id1150085200?uo=4,https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/cd/8b/e1/cd8be174-ec8c-0ddd-933d-398145fbbba3/logo_family_link_color-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-7-0-0-0-85-220-0.png/512x512bb.jpg,2.61.31274,13-04-2017,29-09-2025,0.85,03-10-2025

We all secretly know it. Studies show that too much screen time for children can have many negative effects. We help parents and families get a grip on the issue of kids and phones.

AUTOMATIC TIME LIMITS
Now your child is shown the “5 more minutes please” beforehand. With a suggested or custom daily time limit, you can teach your child time management while maintaining a healthy screen time balance.

AUTOMATICALLY A SAFE INTERNET
Over 5 million websites are automatically filtered for you. As soon as your child tries to access an inappropriate site, we redirect them to a safe site and notify you. Ohana also adjusts search engines to only display child-friendly content.

LOCKED, STUDY or LEISURE
These are our modes that you can set the phone to with just one tap. Apps are then automatically locked and tidying up the room becomes the most important thing after all.

PHONE OFF FOR BEDTIME
Automatic schedules help to put the phone into locked or study mode at certain times. Apps that are not allowed can simply no longer be opened. This way, a restful night is automatically integrated into everyday life.

NEW INSIGHTS EVERY WEEK
You get a brief overview of what happened last week and can easily find out about new apps. Comparison values with other kids help you to evaluate your child.

WORKS BETWEEN ALL DEVICES
Ohana transcends device boundaries and supports different platforms. As a parent on a different platform, you can still control and enjoy all functions independently.

LOCATION SAFETY FEATURE
Some parents want an extra layer of protection in real life. Therefore, we offer a safety feature that allows parents and children to transparently share their location within the family. The function is optional to prevent any potential misuse.

SECURITY & PRIVACY
The security and privacy of parents and children are most important to us. We do not sell your data to third parties. Your data belongs to you and is securely encrypted.

The parent has a preview of the applications available on the child's device and determines which are allowed (safe) and which are not.
• Internet blocking - restricting access to websites.
• Time limit in front of the phone/computer/tablet - limiting the time spent by the child using applications and websites.
After the set time is exceeded, the child will not be able to open the application or website.
• Child locator - geolocation and geofencing.
The parent has a view of the current location of the child and can set limits within which the child can safely move.
• Youtube blocking - the guardian can see the list of content viewed by the child.
• SOS button - the child can start alerting the parent when he finds himself in an emergency.
• Sound level (vibration, sound on) and battery level.
Parents may be informed in specific time intervals about the state of sounds on the child's device and the level of its battery.

How does SafeKiddo work?

We’re not a glorified Pomodoro timer or calendar. We’re a science-based digital program, here to help you manage your ADHD/ADD.

Do you struggle with focus? Organization? Procrastination? What about attention, hyperactivity, and anxiety? Is your calendar, planner, habit tracker, or timer still not helping you organize or get things done? Is your to-do list just not cutting it?

Your ADHD/ADD diagnosis doesn’t have to hold you back. Inflow can help.

Inflow is based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), proven to be effective in the management of ADHD/ADD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder).

Many people see ADHD/ADD as just a deficit or disorder. But the key to thriving with ADHD starts with understanding and embracing your unique ADHD brain.

Start focusing, meet your goals, kick the distraction habit, and start creating a daily structure that works for you. Spend less time planning to be productive, and more time getting things done.

Improve your skills in these areas:

- Focus and Concentration
- Attention and Hyperactivity
- Goal Setting and Consistency
- Mood and Emotional Regulation
- Distraction Reduction
- Cyber Addiction
- Creating a Routine
- Sticking to a Schedule
- Organization
- Time Management
- Impulsivity
- Depression and Anxiety
- Procrastination
- Medication and Treatment Options
- Mindfulness
- Nutrition

...all without an ad in sight.

Inflow provides the tools you need to focus on strategies in your everyday life. We help you build a daily routine habit by habit, a day at a time.

It’s time to tackle your to-do list with ease, whether that’s studying for an exam, organizing your home more effectively, improving your focus, or simply scheduling more time for self-care. Concentrate on what matters most and organize your daily life.

Inflow also sets you up for success with:

- Daily activities and visual reminders integrated easily into your daily life
- Daily focus feature so you can prioritize more effectively
- A stigma-free and supportive ADHD/ADD community to motivate you
- Coworking sessions 

Whatever your goals may be — stronger organization skills, building a more effective to-do list, preventing procrastination, improving attention, reducing hyperactive traits, focusing on others, or simply coping with an ADHD/ADD diagnosis — Inflow can help.

ADHD/ADD can be challenging, but that doesn’t mean accessing support should be! If you’re tired of the day-to-day stress of managing ADHD/ADD, we’re here for you.

You don’t need to have a formal diagnosis or evaluation to use Inflow!

Reminder: While we are an ADHD/ADD app first and foremost, we cover numerous executive function skills, which can be applicable to autism (ASD), OCD, depression, dyslexia, dyspraxia, and more.

“Deleted my other Habit tracker apps



Aside from checking activities off your list, you can classify habits under “Goal” or “Limit”. That got me considering the things I should be cutting down on (like coffee intake).

What might be the most interesting aspect is the “Time Tracker” option. I deleted all the other Habit Tracker apps I had on my phone after playing around with this one… this app just seems more motivating.”



-AliKokua



“Truly checks all the boxes



Download this app immediately. Clean, intuitive interface. Tracks habit building and breaking. Daily task timer. It’s even become my to-do list and reminder app. Can’t speak highly enough of this app and the developer. I had nearly given up.”

[WHAT THE MEDIA SAYS]



Digital Journal: “a global habit tracker”



GQ: “zero distractions and ads”



Yahoo Finance: “habit tracking key player”


[HOW FOCUS CAN HELP]



1. Boost Reading Habits: Distracted easily? Use Focus to increase focus and read more books.


2. Enhance Physical Health: Keep track of your workouts and turn sporadic bursts of energy into a regular exercise routine.


3. Learn New Skills: ADHD is not a limitation - expand your skillset at your own pace.


4. Manage Side Projects: Keep your diverse interests under control, prioritizing and progressing each project effectively.


5. Regularize Self-care: From flossing your teeth to meditation - track and maintain those essential routines.


6. Habit Formation: Understand where your time goes and create habits tailored to your unique brain.


7. Minimize Destructive Habits: Smoke less, reduce alcohol, limit unproductive screen time - use Focus to manage impulsivity.



[WHY CHOOSE FOCUS FOR ADULT ADHD]



-> Individual Activity Trackers: Every activity you track is a step towards understanding and managing your ADHD better.


-> Visual Progress: Visual cues work wonders with ADHD. Watch your growth with beautifully designed statistics.


-> Motivating Reminders & Notifications: Just when you need a nudge, Timecap's reminders can help keep you on track.


-> Flexible Timeframes: Set daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly goals and limits - you're in control.



Unlike other habit trackers, Focus ensures you invest time in what truly matters. Streaks are meaningful and fulfilling. And if one breaks? That's okay - start over and strive to break your personal records.

Welcome to Llama Life! Llama Life is designed to help you focus on ONE thing at a time (single-tasking), and to provide just a liiitle more structure (but not too much) to get things done.

We know you’ve been waiting (thank you!) and we’re super excited to bring our community the mobile app, to help you get through your tasks in the fun, whimsical way, that you know and love. It’s the same tool as the desktop version but adapted for mobile so you can have Llama Life on the go.

HOW DOES LLAMA LIFE WORK?

If you’re new here, a big warm hug! (Anddd, where have you been?!)

Llama Life let’s you set a countdown timer on *every* task. This concept is called ‘timeboxing’, and the idea is to create a (positive) constraint around the time we have to do something. The goal is to try and give a task 100% of our attention, until the timer runs out. This helps to increase focus, and gives us the mental space to think about ONE thing at a time.

Llama Life also let’s you know your total List Time, and the estimated finishing time, so you can be more aware of time passing, and plan your day.

We also love celebrating the wins, big or small, so very importantly, you get confetti (woo hoo!) when you finish a task. You can also personalize with color and emoji to get lots of variety and keep things fresh!

Llama Life offers a 7-day free trial, with a Monthly or Annual subscription.

We’re so glad you’re here, and are rooting for your success!

Let’s go!

Your Llama Life team, and productivity besties,

Marie, Nhi & Guille + Lulu (the llama)

Daily affirmations help rewire our brains, build self-esteem, and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.

Positive affirmations help make major shifts in your mindset, and they also serve as prompts and daily reminders about what you’re truly capable of, ensuring every day is an amazing day

An affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your conscious and unconscious mind. The more you strengthen this connection, the more resilient you’ll be when you experience difficult or challenging circumstances.

As Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe. And the best way to strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.


There are many benefits to using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:


- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words, making it easier to recognize the negative and self-doubting thought patterns holding you back.
- Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want, like achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting, and good, you’re creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen.
- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on its head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.

The treatment includes Focus Score, a first-of-its-kind personalized metric where you can track attention progress.

EndeavorOTC is for adults 18 years and older with ADHD experiencing inattention-related challenges that affect their quality of life such as diminished focus, inability to complete projects or tasks, keep track of important items, and more. Built with the same technology as EndeavorRx, the world's first FDA-authorized video game treatment. EndeavorOTC is available now by subscription. No prescription needed. 

EndeavorOTC was studied in more than 220 participants over a 6-week period. In the clinical trial, 88% of participants saw improvement in their attention and 73% of participants reported quality of life improvements, including an increased ability to balance projects, get things done on time and keep track of important items like phone, wallet, and keys. There were no lasting or serious side effects in any clinical trials for EndeavorOTC. (1,2)

How EndeavorOTC improves focus: The gameplay challenges you to tap targets and navigate obstacles to boost your attention and focus. As you progress through the game, the technology is continuously measuring your performance and using adaptive algorithms to adjust the difficulty and personalize the treatment experience.

How to Play EndeavorOTC: Playing EndeavorOTC can fit into your daily routine. The more you play, the better your results.

Playing the game every day for an initial six weeks can improve your attention and other functions that make up your ability to focus. Users will be given a target Focus Score increase which should be achievable in six weeks. Based on clinical trial data, the target increase provided directly relates to improvement in ADHD-related symptoms and overall quality of life. And, for the vast majority of people, this will leave room for continued improvement in Focus Score and cognitive abilities as well as ADHD symptom management beyond the initial six week course of treatment. 

It is recommended that patients speak to their health care provider before starting EndeavorOTC treatment, and before making any medical decisions.

2) Is your child not motivated to complete their daily tasks?
3) Does your child struggle to remember and stick to their daily routine?

If you answered ""YES"" to at least one of these, then Joon is exactly what you are looking for!

Recommended by Child Psychologists, Occupational Therapists, Pediatricians, and Special Education Teachers, Joon is the future of motivating neurodivergent children. Using a child-friendly video game (for ages 6-12), Joon helps motivate your child to focus and stay on top of their daily routine, tasks, & habits.


**JOON’S GOAL**

Help motivate your child with ADHD, ASD, ODD, General Anxiety, or Depression to focus and complete their daily tasks while learning basic responsibility and independence. Not only does Joon make it extremely easy to motivate kids to do important tasks using a video game, but it also teaches them valuable life skills that they won’t be able to learn in school. We’ve helped over two hundred thousand families complete more than 1M+ tasks, so why can't we help you?


**HOW IT WORKS**

Assign tasks as ""Quests"", then the video game does the rest.

1) Create a few tasks that your child struggles with the most (such as brushing their teeth, getting ready for school, etc.)

2) Your child chooses a virtual pet (called a Doter) to feed, wash, and grow. In order to take care of their pet and play the Joon video game, they must first complete the tasks you've assigned them.

3) Once completed, you will get a notification to review and approve/reject your child's completed tasks. If approved, your child will receive coins to use to care for their pet and unlock different parts of the video game!

4) As your child completes more and more tasks, they will develop habits and improve their daily routine - all because they want to play a video game!


**THE PARENTING TOOL YOU NEED**

+ We make it easy to manage your child’s tasks and add in your existing routine.

+ We'll do the reminding to help your child stick to their routine. No more nagging from your end.

+ Your child will stay motivated to do the tasks assigned to them. In fact, 90% of kids on Joon complete all tasks assigned.

+ Choose from a large list of research-backed activities to help your child build important life skills that teach independence.

Joon is only a year old and already has the attention of press, parenting publications, and parenting experts. To see the complete list, visit our website here: https://joonapp.io


**HOW TO GET STARTED**

1) Install Joon on your device, create your family, and select a few beginning tasks you’d like your child to work on.

2) Help your child set up their account so they can see the tasks that you’ve assigned them. You can have them download Joon on their own device or share you phone.

3) Once your child completes their tasks, you can review and approve them to make sure they were completed correctly.

4) Once approved, your children receive coins and experience points that let them feed, level up, buy things, and progress in the game with their virtual pet. As your child continues to progress in the game, they actually progress in real life too!

5) Keep adding quests (and we’ll recommend you new ones too) to help your children develop good habits! Your children cannot grow on their own. Make sure to stay involved in the process and keep assigning new quests as needed to allow your children to continue helping, learning, growing, and progressing in the game.

===========================================
Plum Village: Zen Guided Meditation App – Main Categories
===========================================

The Plum Village app is split into four easy-to-use categories – meditations, talks, resources, and bells of mindfulness:

MEDITATIONS

Meditation is a deep practice that helps us generate peace and calm, master our mind, develop a healthy headspace, and get deep insights into ourselves and the world around us.

Meditations include deep relaxations, guided contemplations, silent meditations, and eating meditations. Whether you have a little time or a lot, and whether you want to be on your cushion or applying mindfulness in your daily life, there are meditations to nourish, inspire, and incorporate into your daily routine.

TALKS

Listen and learn from the wisdom of Thich Nhat Hanh and other Plum Village meditation teachers
Ask Thay includes hundreds of real-life questions asked to the Zen Master, like “How can we let go of anger? and “How can I stop worrying?” His answers are compassionate and infused with insight.

Dharma Talks are teachings given by Thich Nhat Hanh and others on how to bring Buddhist wisdom and mindfulness into our life. Rather than discussing theoretical concepts, they focus on direct and clear teachings to relieve suffering and create happiness in our day to day lives.

RESOURCES

In Resources you can find a library of daily practices, chants, poems, and songs. These bring to life the practices taught in Plum Village monasteries around the world and offer ways to bring mindfulness into our world, wherever we are.

BELL OF MINDFULNESS

In Plum Village monasteries bells of mindfulness chime at regular intervals. Everybody stops and takes three mindful breaths to pause from their thinking or talking, breathe, and return to their bodies. The Bell of Mindfulness allows us to have the same reminder on our phone.

We can customize the bell to chime at different time periods. Settings include:
• Start time / End time
• Chime intervals
• Bell volume
• Daily repeating schedule

Regular use of the Bell of Mindfulness will cultivate more calm and relaxation in your life.

Well-being is a skill that can be learned. We’re here to guide you along the way.

Backed by four decades of research from world-renowned neuroscientist Dr. Richard Davidson and the team at Healthy Minds Innovations & the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin—Madison, the Healthy Minds Program trains your mind through meditation and podcast-style lessons to develop skills for gaining focus, reducing stress, and maintaining positive social connections.

Research with the Healthy Minds App showed that just 5 minutes a day of practice leads to a 28% reduction in stress, an 18% reduction in anxiety, a 24% reduction in depression, and a 13% increase in social connection.

Featuring our scientific Awareness, Connection, Insight, and Purpose, Well-being Framework, the Healthy Minds Program is a holistic, all-encompassing meditation app that offers the best of both guided meditations and opportunities to learn. You’ll learn simple skills to enhance personal well-being, build healthy relationships, and improve communication, performance, and creativity.

With a gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life. 
 
To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.

And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.

Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:

1. GRATITUDE JOURNAL

A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life.

In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life.

The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling.

You can also add photos to your journal entries and can record journals in your voice, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts. 

2. POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS

If you’ve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you’ve probably heard about affirmations.

Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves.

They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.

The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need.

You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.

Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.

3. CREATE VISION BOARDS

Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called a dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.

In the Gratitude app, we’ll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!

4. DAILY ZEN

We understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app.

Here, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.

5. MINDFUL MINUTES

We define the Mindful minutes as the time that you spend in the Gratitude app. You can view the mindful minutes under 'All Health Data' section in the Health app provided by Apple. Currently, the app does not read any data from the health app. We don't write any data in the health app without your consent. You can turn on the mindful minutes from the profile & settings in the Gratitude app.

Why Waking Up Stands Out
Unlike conventional meditation apps, Waking Up blends practice with theory—so you not only learn to meditate but also understand how it transforms your mind. It’s meditation, science, and timeless wisdom in one place.

Topics & Techniques
Our library combines contemplative traditions with modern science, offering tools for both practice and understanding. Techniques include mindfulness (Vipassana), Loving-Kindness, body scans, Yoga Nidra, and nondual awareness practices from Dzogchen, Zen, and Advaita Vedanta. Topics span neuroscience, psychology, Stoicism, ethics, psychedelics, productivity, and happiness.

Content & Teachers
Created by neuroscientist and best-selling author Sam Harris, Waking Up features leading voices in meditation, philosophy, and psychology:
- Practice—Vipassana, Zen, Dzogchen, Advaita Vedanta (Joseph Goldstein, Diana Winston, Adyashanti, Henry Shukman, Richard Lang)
- Theory—Philosophy and science of consciousness, ethics, and well-being (Alan Watts, Charlotte Joko Beck, Joan Tollifson, James Low, Douglas Harding)
- Life—Mindfulness in relationships, productivity, Stoicism, and more (David Whyte, Oliver Burkeman, Matthew Walker, Amanda Knox, Donald Robertson, Bob Waldinger)
- Conversations—Sam Harris with Yuval Noah Harari, Michael Pollan, Morgan Housel, Roland Griffiths, Cal Newport, Shinzen Young, and more
- Q&As—Sam Harris with Joseph Goldstein, Adyashanti, Henry Shukman, Jack Kornfield, Loch Kelly

Created by Sam Harris
Neuroscientist and best-selling author Sam Harris built Waking Up as the resource he wished he’d had when he began meditating 30 years ago. Every practice, course, and teacher is chosen for its power to change lives.

Regulate your nervous system with Open. Bridge science and spirituality to cleanse your body and mind. Learn breathwork, meditation, and movement techniques designed by experts in neurobiology. Practice on the app and in-person at our flagship studio in Los Angeles. 

CLASSES

BREATHE: Since the dawn of civilization, humans have developed techniques for manipulating our breath to induce desired states of consciousness. Now peer-reviewed studies in neuroscience and psychology confirm that breathwork is a powerful toolkit for regulating your nervous system, optimizing your health and well-being, and catalyzing personal transformation. Breathwork is an umbrella term for myriad practices, both ancient and modern. While many techniques are deeply rooted in spiritual traditions like Yoga, Qi Gong, and Buddhism, contemporary applications integrate ancient wisdom with modern science.This synthesis of ancient and modern has given rise to transformational breathwork, designed to induce profound experiences of catharsis, insight, and breakthrough. Experience a mental reset with just a few minutes of conscious breathing.


MEDITATE: Train your awareness and contemplate wisdom – with techniques that span generations, cultures, and traditions – with our daily meditations and monthly programs. Learn how to enhance your focus, reduce your stress and anxiety, and regulate your emotions with simple mindfulness techniques you can incorporate into your daily life. 


MOVE: Our methodology is designed through the intelligence of fitness – blending endurance, strength, mobility, and recovery – with the wisdom of mindfulness. A ritual for resilience, strengthening the body and mind.

ANYTIME, ANYWHERE: Practice on your time with our endless library, with fresh classes added daily. From simple 5-minute breathwork techniques, to 60-minute strength and conditioning classes, build your practice to fit your schedule and meet your goals. Whether you’re starting your journey or seeking a new challenge, there are classes for every level and mood.

PROGRESS TRACKING: Create a daily habit that sticks with progress tracking, push reminders, streaks, and badges. A consistent breathwork and meditation practice has proven to reduce cortisol levels and regulate the nervous system–decreasing stress, supporting emotional well-being, and enhancing mental clarity. These techniques can also improve physical health by increasing heart rate variability, promoting cardiovascular health, and boosting immune function.

""3 Minute Mindfulness is a wonderful addition, and it helps me on a daily basis. The app reminds me to stop and breathe no matter what situation I find myself in."" - Karla, App Review


What actually is Mindfulness?
Mindfulness is defined as paying attention in the present moment, without judgment. Put another way, Mindfulness is about noticing what is happening around you right now.


How do you practice Mindfulness?
There are many ways to practice mindfulness and bring yourself into the present moment, including meditations, breathing exercises, feeling for sensations and more!
For example, try taking a deep breath in through your nose... And breathe out through your mouth. Congratulations! You just did a Mindfulness exercise. In that moment you paid complete attention to your breath, without any judgments.


How will Mindfulness help?
Research has shown that mindfulness can help you:
- Improve sleep
- Reduce stress
- Relieve anxiety
- Increase number of positive feelings
- Calm your mind
- Increased focus

App Features:
- The 7 Days of Mindfulness course. Learn practical mindfulness exercises that can be applied to your day to day life. There are 7 lessons, spread out over 7 days. Each lesson is approximately 3 minutes short!
- Guided meditations to help you reduce stress, relieve anxiety and even help you sleep. All in just 3 minutes!
- A range of breathing exercises that each have different benefits. They include Square Breathing (great for taking control of your mind), 4-7-8 Breathing (this has been called a natural tranquilliser, making it perfect for getting to sleep), and more! You can even create your own breathing exercises.
- Create your own reminders to be mindful

WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING
This app is incredible. I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******

I have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****

In addition, Declutter The Mind offers 30-day courses that will teach you how to meditate, form the habit of a regular practice, and expand your mind through the teachings of mindfulness meditation.

This is all without positioning meditation as something mystical, spiritual, or supernatural for it to work for you. The science already shows that a regular meditation practice improves mental health and happiness. Let our app help you unlock these benefits without attaching it to something woo-woo.

Declutter The Mind offers a practical and easy approach to sitting down and observing the mind. With enough practice, you’ll start to have insights into your mind, how it works, and how busy it is. These insights can make you a calmer, less reactive, and happier person.

WHAT IS MEDITATION
If you want to understand the mind, sit down and observe it. Meditation is using a non-judgemental awareness to notice what thoughts, feelings, and sensations appear in consciousness. It’s about becoming aware of just how busy the mind is, and breaking away from that momentum. Buddhists call this the monkey mind, the mind that’s constantly busy and chattering, sometimes without us even fully noticing it. We can call this clutter, and this app will help you declutter the mind.

HOW IT WORKS
Meditation doesn’t require any special equipment, or crossing your legs in a particular way, or holding your fingers out. You just need a comfortable and quiet spot where you can remain undisturbed for 10 minutes. Once you’ve found your spot, choose the guided meditation that best suits your needs. If you’re unsure where to start, check out the Essentials category to find meditations for beginners. Choose the session, select your length, and follow the guided instructions.

As Simple As Possible, But No Simpler

Brightmind’s motto is, “make it as simple as possible, but no simpler”. So Brightmind takes deep and transformative practices and explains them in practical ways. Making things as simple as possible—but not any simpler—leads to efficient and effective learning and growth.

Your One-Stop-Shop

In addition to daily award-winning guided meditations, Brightmind offers everything you need to maintain a life-changing practice.

Community Chat

Ask questions and share your experiences of practice with Brightminders from all over the world. Offer and receive support for any behavior change goal (diet, exercise, substances, etc.) in our Accountability & Support Groups.

Daily Sits

Meditating with friends is ten times easier and more fun than meditating alone. Join any of our four daily community sits! I (Toby) usually join the 12pm, ET sit : )

1-on-1 Coaching

Confused about something you learned in the guided meditations? Not sure what to do when this or that happens during your meditation practice? I got you.

I (Toby) make sure to set aside time in my schedule for one-on-one sessions. By offering information, accountability, emotional support, and inspiration, I’ll help you overcome challenges and take advantage of opportunities in your meditation practice.

Retreats

Retreats—more so than daily practice—change the way your mind works. Retreats really move the needle. They’re also a great way to connect with Brightmind’s global community of dedicated practitioners. We gather for four hours on the fourth Saturday of every month.

About Us 

Toby Sola 

Toby Sola is dedicated to helping you create a feedback loop between your meditation practice and your ability to make the world a better place. So the more you meditate, the more effective you are in the world. And the more effective you are, the deeper your meditation practice becomes.

Toby has been teaching meditation for two decades. His craft as a teacher has been refined through years of monastic training and close collaboration with the world-renowned teacher Shinzen Young. Toby is an award-winning designer and the founder of Brightmind.

Shinzen Young

Shinzen Young trained for a decade in monasteries in Asia, and has been teaching in the West for over 50 years. As the Co-director of the SEMA lab, he’s now at the forefront of contemplative neuroscience. So Shinzen is unique in that he brings together an authentic and deep understanding of meditation with the rigor and precision of modern science.

Shinzen likes to say of himself: “I’m a Jewish-American Buddhist teacher who got turned on to comparative mysticism by an Irish-Catholic priest and who has developed a Burmese-Japanese fusion practice inspired by the spirit of quantified science.” : )

The owl is flying across your pages, annoying you, criticizing you, giving you psychological exercises, and closing your tabs. If you are not serious about being productive, this extension may not be for you.*** August 2025 - Upgraded to Manifest Version 3.0 ================================================================= Do you need a new boss when working from home? Meet the Productivity Owl. The owl is very strict. He will berate and mock you. You'll be forced to complete tasks to earn break time. If you do consistent work, use the timeboxing scheduler for work/vacation, and complete the owl's psychological exercises then you might be able to earn the owl's respect. Just like the first version, the owl has 3 types of websites: Allowed, Blocked and Countdown. If a website is not on the allowed/blocked lists, you'll get a certain amount of time to get the information you need before the owl closes the tab. You can still use the scheduler to schedule free-time, and now you can also schedule work time. Version 2.0 introduced a task manager, and you get rewarded break minutes for each task you complete. There are also psychological interventions and browsing statistics in this version. Although it is technically possible to earn the owl's respect - it's highly unlikely. The owl is very judgmental. It may take years before anyone earns the owl's ""ultimate respect."" Of course if you uninstall the extension or disable it, all respect is lost. *************** APACHE 2.0 LICENSE OPEN SOURCE *************** Since this extension is on every webpage you visit, I wanted to let everyone know there are NO TRACKERS or DATA COLLECTORS in the owl.

Why it’s better: • Automatic countdown from your Calendar – join a Meet, and the Google Meet countdown timer starts with the correct duration. • Mini SubTimer (new) – time tasks, speaking turns, or agenda points without touching the main timer. • Share across tabs – show the timer on every tab so it appears on your shared screen. • Stay on track – halftime/overtime color cues, optional sound alerts, and overlap warnings. • Drag & drop – place the timer where you want; we remember the position. • Quick access to upcoming events – open the extension popup to see and join your next meetings. Two ways to use it: • Automatic: Connect Google Calendar once. The timer counts down for any Meet that matches your event. • Manual: Set a duration yourself. Great when there’s no calendar event, or an event couldn't be matched.

For consumers in the European Union,Extension,0,5.0,5,0.0,0.0,Free,"OverviewAdds a high-contrast outline around the element with keyboard focusI predominantly use my keyboard to navigate websites, but many sites don't always make it clear where the keyboard is focused. This extension aims to help solve that issue by putting a white or black border around the focused element, depending on whichever results in a higher contrast. Focus Indicator uses multiple strategies to aim for it to work effectively across all websites, but it can't account for every improper accessibility setup. For example, if a site has a focusable element out of the screen's bounds, it won't show any difference. It also doesn't affect which elements are able to be focused with the keyboard. It prioritizes function over form. If you'd like, you can disable the extension on certain sites (blacklist them) or you can enable the extension only on certain sites (whitelist them). All settings can be configured by clicking on the extension's icon. There are two focus indication methods, depending on your preference: 1. Overlay (default, new with version 2) - Works by having a floating outline above the current focused element's position - Almost guaranteed to show the outline if it is possible to, EVEN IF the focused element is behind another element 2. On Element - Works by modifying the current element's focused styles - The indicator will sometimes end up partly or fully covered up by other elements, but it can be less intrusive Overlay Mode settings: - Indicator color mode - Solid (default) - The outline will be either solid black or solid white - Hybrid - The outline will be a black and white inversion of whatever is directly behind each individual portion of it - Outline width (default: 4px) - Adjust the thickness of the outline - Outline offset (default: 1px) - Set how much space there is between the element and the outline - Use transition between focused elements (default: off) - Animates focus shifts for better visual tracking - Use ""On Element"" mode for text input elements (default: on) - The overlay may cover text while typing in certain text input elements, mainly in online code editors, so ""On Element"" mode can be used for just those elements insteadSee less",,https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ieandfkgbncmapkpgchnffbodegkemea?hl=en,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DMDvRjFQzgh7IGwjQNST5tJAs_gRC5p6x5HqGILjlLvPmS6l_ktgPHcZ862-7fs8O6GKg--_XEScnDptXoRFVbKW=s128-rj-sc0x00ffffff,"UpdatedMarch 6, 2025",Unknown,Unknown,0.525,03-10-2025

Site blocker is designed to help you stay focused on studying, learning, and working. Blocks all time-westing websites to keep you productive and away from all the distractions the internet offers.

Meanwhile, that important task? Still sitting there, untouched. Hedge is here to help break this cycle. It's not another complicated ""productivity system"" – it's a straightforward Chrome extension that helps you stay focused by keeping you away from the sites that always seem to pull you away from what matters.

Because your focus time should match your actual work schedule. 🎯 Goal-Aligned Blocking: Set your work hours and active days to automatically keep distracting sites at bay when you need to focus. Because we all know willpower alone isn't enough. ⚡ Smart Pomodoro Timer: Built-in 25-minute focus sessions with short (5-minute) and long (15-minute) breaks help you maintain actual, sustainable productivity. No more ""just 5 more minutes"" that turns into 3 hours. 🔒 Flexible Site Access: Block entire domains (like youtube*) or specific pages. Whitelist the stuff you actually need, blacklist the stuff that keeps stealing your time. Simple as that. ☢️ Nuclear Mode: When you absolutely, positively MUST get something done, enable Nuclear Mode. It locks your blocking settings until your predetermined time is up.
