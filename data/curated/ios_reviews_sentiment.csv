,1022831885,,Robokiller: Spam Call Blocker,"I downloaded RoboKiller with the impression that I would be notified before the free trial ended, giving me the chance to decide whether or not to continue. That promise was never honored—without a single alert, I was charged $130.

The most frustrating part is that the app itself barely functions as advertised. Numerous spam and junk calls still slipped through without being filtered, making the subscription essentially worthless. What makes matters worse is that the app’s effectiveness seems to depend heavily on your iOS version and carrier, creating an inconsistent and unreliable experience.

I reached out for support and have received no response whatsoever, which only underscores how little accountability this company shows its customers. At best, this app is ineffective. At worst, it feels like a deliberate scam—charging a premium fee while delivering a subpar product and ignoring customer concerns.

If you value your money and peace of mind, I strongly urge you to avoid this app.",1,Don’t-subscribe,2025-09-06 13:37:04-07:00,negative

As a multi-year customer who remembers how app used to work this is very troubling. I basically paid $80 for a useless program. All I can say is BUYER BEWARE, don’t waste your money, and learn from my mistake. 

I’ve been a subscriber for 4 years, unfortunately this app no longer works (and is WAY OVERPRICED) Ever since app updated 2 weeks ago (right after price increase) the app has decided to stop working. I have an older iPhone on iOS 15.8.3 so app should work. I’ve deleted app, rebooted to flush cache / memory and re-installed app as per their instructions … which fixed nothing. I also “submitted a bug” per their website and all I’ve gotten back is a generic email reply thanking me for reaching out. No ticket# re: bug, nothing. So I was basically charged 79.99 for an app that no longer works. YMMV, but I would highly recommend looking elsewhere atm. UPDATE, as of 01-13-2024 RoboKiller rolled out yet another update last week [Version 24.7.16] and application still does not work. After clean install app just hangs & then crashes while trying to load. As of now, I’ve still paid 79.99 and no longer have access to apps features/services.",1,Keyser.Soze.,2025-09-29 15:49:53-07:00,negative

,1029207872,,Google Keep - Notes and lists,"It’s great to have it sync with family and Google Home.

But my primary use case is shared lists, and Keep has horrible accessibility.

On iOS, there is a three second timeout after which keyboard focus leaves a list item, finalizing the list item with whatever text was input. If you are a slow typer or use alternate input means - or even if you just need a few seconds to form your thoughts - google keep interrupts you.

You end up with empty list items because you didn’t type fast enough. You end up making multiple list items instead of one. You end up cut off with half written list items.

Unless you are a fast typer who always has fully formed thoughts ready to input without pause, this app is nearly unusable.

This no doubt demonstrates the limitations of a formulaic user testing process. I have a hunch that the Keep QA team has list entry items ready to go, and quickly runs through tests, rather than testing real world use cases - especially with a variety of accessibility considerations.",1,RCPeterson,2025-06-01 10:18:44-07:00,negative

Wow!  I am so happy and relieved. I found a way to block internet stories about Trump!  Like him or hate him...there is just too much about him every day!  It was overwhelming. 

I downloaded Roadblock because it also allows “custom settings”.  After one email exchange with the developer, in the custom settings I wrote “Trump”, and now 90% of the stories never show on my browser and the 10% that slip through don’t allow me to click through to the article!!!  

The developer wrote that the app “currently only allows filtering based on things that match in the URL. For example, you can block URLs if ""trump"" appears anywhere in the URL.”  That is why I got a 90% success rate instead of 100%. 

The developer then wrote: “We will add the ability to hide content based on matching things in URLs in the next update.”  

For my purposes, the 90% Reduction in Trump stories is amazing for my internet experience.  Then, with the blocking of “advertising”, I am thrilled with this app.

This is an excellent app for anyone to use as a self-care method, even if you do not have a mental health condition. It’s very helpful to be able to track your moods and to notice trends and changes over a period of time. My only issue is that I wish the questions were not so repetitive.

,1055295863,,Today Habit tracker,"There is a lot to love about this app but it is missing a few key functions that make habit tracking more successful. In addition to “check ins” (positive score) there ought to be a way to record “missed check -ins” (negative score) and just also a way to log days where you missed your habit but it was intentional (neutral/no penalty score). The metrics of only seeing your number of check ins is a useless metric without also seeing those days you dropped the ball. 

It’s also be great to see two habits side by side so you can see if your “early to bed” habit has a correlation to “deep work” the following day—another reason why showing “missed” days would be useful. 

I like how you can schedule a habit that has a once/week (or whatever) frequency but I’d love to see a countdown on that habit so you know, “3 more days left in week to accomplish habit”

The app has beautiful backgrounds and a lovely font.

Like being able to have an X and Y axis or just chart two different units on one chart. Also they mentioned to do lists in the description but really it’s just “milestones”. You can’t edit the tasks in milestones to become recurring or duplicate tasks. I was hoping to use them as a daily checklist for certain things, but they will not work for that. Ultimately I think with a little bit more personalization and expanding the cards in habits this could be even better than it already is - and it’s already great!",4,jordveezy,2021-11-27 11:22:06-07:00,positive

The cover pictures for each habit is a fine idea but as other reviewers have mentioned, the selection is very limited and more importantly in notifications it often shows the wrong picture different from what you've selected. Hopefully this is addressed in a future update. Also when I open the app it just takes you to the last habit that was open which is usually exactly what you don't need since you just completed it and are probably looking to check in a different habit. Starting at the homescreen with the list of habits or having a way to choose your homescreen would be helpful. All in all a nice clean app that does its job well.

I’ve gone on her phone (a Moto G4) and given the app permission and chosen high accuracy for location and still the app says she’s all over town, when she’s in her room and her phone on the dining table. The second issue is the app spontaneously shuts down while I am adding tasks. I have an iPhone and she has aMoto G4. Maybe this is the issue?

This app has brought peace to this screen time issue in our house and really is very useful to me, even with some of these issues. Keep on it developers!

,1067755201,,Alarm & Timer,"Apple's default clock app and the way their alarms work has annoyed me since its inception. I have ADHD and I really struggle with time blindness, so I use alarms on my phone set every ten minutes to keep myself on time when getting ready for work in the morning to remind me of how much time has passed and prompt me to move on to the next task, when to leave the house, etc. Apple's clock app has always been so clunky and inconvenient to use in the ways I need to use it. This app allows the perfect customization I need and works even better than I expected!! 

features I especially love about this app:

- you can put alarms in folders and turn all alarms in those folders on/off at once without effecting any of your other alarms!

- you can turn on a feature that displays ONE button to turn on/off ALL alarms at once without having to go in and click each one on/off individually!

- once you create one alarm, it remembers those settings when creating your next series of alarms so you don't have to tediously set the same settings over and over!

- there is a button on each alarm that allows you to skip that alarm for just the next time it is set to go off! which is perfect for my ADHD brain, which is prone to forgetting to turn that alarm back on again if I had to turn it off just for one day.

- you can create a schedule and set alarms to go off at a specific date and time! great for reminding me about bills and such each month.

- when the alarm goes off, a banner notification appears that actually reads the time! I watch YouTube when getting ready for work, and this is so helpful to tell me the time without exiting the YT app. Apple's just says ""Alarm Clock"" without the time, it's so annoying. 

- there is a setting you can turn on that sends a notification every time you leave the app to make sure you turn off silent mode so you don't accidentally not hear your alarms, which is great for my forgetful ADHD brain. (alarms don't sound on silent mode)

Stuff I wish the app had (but is not a necessity for it to still be great):

- It would be cool if when the alarm goes off, there was an option to have the time read aloud.",5,kjhagen94,2025-06-23 09:37:25-07:00,positive

If I’m in a different app on my phone the alarm doesn’t go off….. only if in locked mode does it work. And even then-  it doesn’t always go off. I had 2 alarms set within 10 minutes of each other (precautionary) - no headphones were plugged in-   to grab a shower before an early flight, my alarms never went off - either one of them.

The problem is that the alarm sound is MEDIA, not a system sound. So your media volume must be turned up for the alarm to work (which I only found out when I failed to get up on time to pick friends up from the ferry).

I'm just going through the settings and there's so many customizable options! Naturally the color scheme, but you can also upload a background picture. You can change the fonts, the language, military time, whether you want 09:00 or 9:00, whether midnight displays as 00 or 12. You can decide whether you want seconds on both the digital and analogue clocks.

However, there are a couple of things that I’d absolutely love to see in the next updates, and both have to do with (generally) the same thing. One: it would be great if we could choose which apps are allowed while we’re ‘Flipd’ off. There are a few apps that I need to use while studying, like Desmos, Google Classroom and similar apps. Two: the same goes for the ‘Full Lock Mode.’ I love the idea of it, but being able to keep select apps would be amazing. These two things are the only reasons I’m not using the app every time I study.

No, I am not the developer, I was just so ecstatic to find it after dealing with this Tally app and its ridiculousness and obscene pricing scheme and not being able to subtract counts.

,1110684238,,Brain.fm: Focus & Sleep Music,"I’m 23 weeks in using this app and it is my most important tool. I came to brain.fm for the variety and I stayed because I found I can actually focus. 

I’ve tried several things to calm my monkey mind and give it something to occupy itself with while I work, read or plan. I’ve had a waterfall on my desk physically and monitor virtually , I’ve listened to classical music (thank you Mozart), I’ve listened to white noise, tried brown noise, and I even bought an album with nothing but the sounds of a coffee shop (a favorite by the way) I’ve listened to more audiobooks than I can count(for the more repetitive tasks).  I’ve even tried working on my computer in VR to shut out distractions (how much battery do I have left?)

I tried brain.fm because the coffee shop was getting old but I’ve found that (coupled with noise canceling headphones or even regular earbuds), I can sit at the kitchen table in the middle of life happening and still focus on what I’m doing.  Where my wife walking by used to throw me off, now I barely notice.  It’s almost like VR. I’ve also been attacking my distractibility from other angles but, I was using brain.fm before that. 

As I’ve used it I gradually added in or took away certain sounds. I’ve liked what I liked and thumb downed what I didn’t (the evil drone didn’t work for me) I’ve done the meditation, I tried sleep but it pulled a Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon and scared me awake after lulling me off, easily fixable with a thumb down. 

Thank you guys for a great app and the work you’ve put into it. If the science is just a scam don’t tell me about it because it’s been working great for me.  I suspect there has to be something to the science though because every now and then I stop and realize “I’ve been working on this for 2 hours?”",5,Nvariant,2024-07-24 06:12:58-07:00,positive

,1110684238,,Brain.fm: Focus & Sleep Music,"I have ADHD and suffer from severe difficulty focusing on a frequent basis. I’m also musically inclined so listening to normal music in the background is usually more distracting than helpful. I had heard trusted influencers recommend Brain.fm but I was skeptical at first because I already pay for music subscriptions and macOS and iOS come with native sounds of nature you can play on repeat so it seemed like I should be able to get by without spending more money, especially when it’s a significant amount. I tried looking up the research to see if it was legit studies proving the music actually helps someone focus and my attempts were inconclusive.

Nevertheless, I tried the trial and noticed an immediate difference in my ability to focus. The music is not distracting but just fades into the background. I was also afraid it wouldn’t have enough diversity of music or genres to choose from but they actually have a ton of diversity and are continuously coming out with new tracks. I try new stuff all the time and haven’t yet heard it all. I also expanded to the other types of music, for meditation and for sleeping, when needed. Sometimes I get a little craving for real music in the background but I still want the cognitive effects of brain.fm so I will layer it by playing it from the brain.fm website a little softer volume than my Apple Music while I’m working and this works well.

There of course is no magic bullet for ADHD but I have been using it for 30 straight weeks now and I believe it is an indispensable tool in my arsenal for treating ADHD without medication.",5,DanCates,2024-06-09 05:06:16-07:00,positive

Maybe walkthroughs, insights, and suggestions how I should interpret and make changes from the progress reports.

Now it seems to be problematic with updating the screened call list (sometimes over 10-12 hours) and it rarely blocks or identifies any calls.  Advice from the developer was to reinstall which I did several times with no change.  The calls that are blocked are when I turn on the iPhone setting of blocking calls not on the contact list.

I’m curious if this downward slide was with the priority now being the Max version as the Max release was right around the time of the beginnings or the poor performance on the original version.

I would love to upgrade to the Max version but honestly with the bigger price and this history of waning performance of the original version, I worry about what would happen if they release another similar but new product.",2,Felonius Funk,2024-11-14 15:52:11-07:00,negative

Also using it for my stretching; created a 10 step timer easily copying the first step, so I don't have to keep count.

,1149192857,,Habit Hub: Routine & Schedule,"Benjamin Franklin said to give each part of your business the time it needs. This app helps me organize my week so that I have confidence I will have time to do all the tasks and activities that are important for achieving my goals. 

I love the simple interface for setting timeslots that reappear at the moment you need them each day, week or month. 

I find this app gives me the nudge I need to do my workout, prepare a good dinner, process my inbox, and all the other activities that I tend to be lazy about. 

What I like best though is the feeling that I can have confidence I will get it all done, one step at a time, by just following my own plan, aided by this app.

Its strength lies in simplicity—no typing required—making daily entries effortless and consistent. The app excels at visualizing mood trends and habit patterns over weeks or months, ideal for mental health awareness or routine tracking. Free features are generous, but the premium upgrade unlocks deeper insights (goals, unlimited activities) and removes ads, though the one-time purchase option is a welcome reprieve from subscription fatigue. However, the lack of text-based prompts or rich formatting limits its appeal for reflective writers, and repetitive logging can feel robotic over time. Occasional syncing hiccups and a clunky backup system also nag. Perfect for **casual users seeking a low-effort mood diary**, but those craving narrative depth may pair it with traditional journaling apps.

Like being able to keep updated on how your friends may be feeling? It should still definitely be private and have options of what specific you want to share with the friend(s) but most generally is where you may be emotionally, and the second thing is I kinda wish is hourly mood changes so like within just one day?

I see that you replied to this review. I already clicked through to the location to which you directed me, &repeatedly tried to report a billing problem.

,1203637303,,Fabulous: Daily Habit Tracker,"I have been using this app for a few weeks, and I plan to use it for the next few months to incorporate some healthier habits in to my day. I have been going through a fertility journey that has caused depression and a feeling of being stuck and lost. I used to be very disciplined, so I am hoping this app will help me get back on track and I can honestly say that it already has in a short amount of time. 

Some of the things I love: the app will choose simple habits for you (like drink water first thing in the morning, stretch for 1 minute every day). When you’re depressed, it can be hard to think of and create these goals for yourself, so I love that they choose them for you. I also love the daily coaching and how they seamlessly integrate it in to your routine. The lessons are helpful and I have learned a lot about my behaviors. 

Some of the things I don’t love: there is A LOT going on in this app. The first time I opened it, I immediately thought to myself, “there is no way I will be using this for more than a day” because it was wildly overwhelming and confusing. I decided to push through, and I have a general idea of where things are now, but I still don’t understand the flow of the app. This needs a lot of work. There is also a ton of advertising for there other apps, which needs to be toned down.

,1203637303,,Fabulous: Daily Habit Tracker,"Setting up the account for this walked me through steps which prompted me to start with paying minimum $1 to use the app generally. I selected the $1 option and chose to skip about 5 “offers” for other apps and declined what I thought was premium. The app then welcomed me to premium, and when I went to my account settings I was subscribed to pay over $20 a month. After I cancelled the subscription immediately, I checked the invoice link through settings which shows a $30+ purchase, with the plan scheduled to cancel at the end of the month. Overall extremely confusing interface. I’m sure the app is helpful to some behaviorally, but I will not be trying it given the risk of spending more than I am aware of. 

This part is just nitpicky, but: the ai generated art used across the platform is tough on the eyes. For example, when setting a goal to drink water, there is a generated image of a man holding a water bottle behind his face, and a blue mouth. Off-putting. 

To the devs: I hope you can reduce the amount of repetitive payment prompts when using the app, as it creates more opportunities for accidental subscription—your application is advertised to people who are in a hard place, do not make it worse by adding financial worry. And for the graphics, try some softer color contrasts? Have the art either produced by a graphic designer or make it simple vectors.

,1210209691,,Oak - Meditation & Breathing,"I have over a decade of experience meditating but have fell out of practice for a while. So I wanted to try an app to help me get back into having a consistent practice again. I tried some of the other well known apps (that also cost money), and didn’t like them. I did a search for free meditation apps & Oak was on the list.

I have to say I love this app. It is no frills while also being so well-designed. Oftentimes free apps are hideous & dated, have bad UI, and functionality issues. Not Oak! It’s minimal design gets out of the way, looks gorgeous, and functions so well. There are no ads either, which is also rare for a free app.

The options for guided & unguided meditation are superior compared to others I’ve seen. The guided meditation instructors give cues while also knowing when to shut up & let you do the actual practice. Can’t stand it when a guided meditation instructor doesn’t stop talking - it gets in the way of the practice & becomes distracting rather than helpful. But Oak’s guided meditations strike a good balance & I really like them. 

The unguided option is great too. I like that they have the option to add or remove chimes at whatever interval you choose (5, 10, 20 mins, etc). It helps keep you focused & also helps if you start wondering how long you have left. And you can set whatever length of time you want for your session - it uses the scrolling time feature that the timer uses on your iPhone. Like if for whatever reason you wanted to do some odd number that’s not a real interval, like 23 minutes, you could. LoL.

There’s also guided courses you can take around a specific theme. The one I’m doing is a 10 day mantra class with each session being about 15-25 minutes. Love it.",5,dreemplaces,2023-05-02 07:09:32-07:00,positive

The UI also behaves a little oddly while reordering items in a list. For example, if reordering tasks in a list, it’s very easy to accidentally drop one task on top of another which unintentionally turns it into a sub-task. If reordering steps within a task, it’s easy to slide your finger too far to the right which will remove the step from the task and promote it to a task.

Even programmed routines are done wrong. She plays sleep sounds when I say “goodnight” (meant to just turn off all my lights). Just today I’m watching a class lecture on my tv and she’s still playing the sleep sounds at 2pm.

It was very confusing how to use the app. I was in contact after that with the developer who was absolutely wonderful to work with and he helped me maximize the app and understand the power in the “box”
This is a very innovative way to deliver hypnosis. Their content is very well done as well. I particularly like the voice of the British male, I think his name is Martin Heckman, it’s just addictive!
My star rating is really more like 4.5. I know they will keep working on the user experience to make it the best 5 star app on the market and in two months I already see some improvements.

I find the proograms very helpful. I initially used the app to prepare me for surgery. It worked really well and I had a very peaceful surgery and recovery. I spent about two weeks with various programs to relieve anxiety, minimize fear and anxiety, and find peace in the decision I had made.
I’m back on the app now to work on finding motivation to get back to my regular life and relive some post op depression.  Just finished my first session and it reminded me how great this tool box is and I’m looking forward to more sessions.

Suggestion: create a calendar and reminders so the user schedules in their daily hypnosis.
Another idea would be to create more predefined sessions based on user input on what they’re looking to work on.

,1253577148,,HabitMinder • Habit Tracker,"This app is exactly what you need. Believe me.
It helps you think the way you should be thinking.
One of the good things about this app is that you can use it in whatever way you see fit.
I will share with you the way I use the app (I might be one of the only ones to use it like this, but it’s awesome).
One of the problems I’ve always had when trying to take on a new habit was that, once I missed my “streak”, it was hard to get back to it. For instance, let’s say I start going to the gym, boom, two months in, haven’t missed a day, you feel AWESOME. But then, the day comes where you just can’t go, now what? Now you missed your streak, you broke your word, what’s even the point of going tomorrow, you’re a failure.
Well, not so fast.
With habit minder, the DEBT is still there, if you had a goal to read 30 pages a day, and the day comes where you can’t do it, nothing stops you from reading 60 pages the following day. If you want to go to the gym five times a week (monday through friday) and you missed a day, there is nothing stopping you from going on saturday and finishing that workout you were supposed to do on wednesday. I mean, wow.
It is also really visual and it helps you see the habits you are not following through, it helps you see the things you are avoiding, and that is an amazing insight into your personality, it shows what you are running away from. Why are you so scared, go and do it (literally talking to myself rn)!
So yeah, amazing app, like Jordan Peterson says, you will not get where you wanna get by accident, you have to have it written down, and go for it consciously, and at the end of the day, if you WRITE DOWN YOUR GOALS, and you don’t forget about them (which is what this app ensures), you will be a more successful person in a year, even if you only hit them 50% of the time (A LOT BETTER THAN 0), if you have 70% completion rate, out of 20 habits or so? Wow, you’re on the right path, and you can always strive for more next month, my current goal is 80% completion rate out of all my 22 habits (currently at 79%), and a 60% minimum in any given habit (which is really hard cause some of them are tough lol).
Oh well, what can I say, thank you guys for developing this amazing tool, and I feel like I’m stealing from you guys with the 9.99$ a year (like really, are you kidding me guys? why not subscribe??) BEST 10$ INVESTMENT I EVER MADE

However, to mark that I’ve completed the habit it wants me to run a timer. I would rather just use the quick add options just like the premade exercise habit. Also, when creating a monthly habit you have to choose if it occurs at the beginning, middle, or end of the month. I would prefer to have it as anytime of the month so that I could see the habit on my list. Or another option could be to add a section that tells you about your upcoming habits, kind of like a calendar.

,1260462853,,Ad blocker by Magic Lasso,A very effective Safari extension that blocks most all ads & trackers without any user input? Yep. Ability to make your own blocking rules as you go? Yep. Tap to block unwanted elements on any webpage? Yep. Several more features to list but you’ll figure them out. Suffice to say it’s still a little obtuse in some regards. You have to discover some of its features on your own. For instance if you’re trying to block YouTube ads it won’t always work. You’ll get YouTube’s terms of service warning page instead. Unless you pull to refresh the content you want to watch multiple times then it’ll load up without the ads. This little tip isn’t listed in the apps rules or on the developer website & probably for good reason (though I suppose I’ve let the cat out of the bag now myself if it was meant to be a hush hush pro-tip… Oops). It doesn’t always work due to YouTube’s constant battle trying to circumvent ad blockers. But when it does it’s magic just like the name implies. Seems a bit expensive at first but it includes family sharing for the price so it’s really a bargain in my view. Make it so the rules auto update without me having to open the app itself & it’s a 5 star rating.,5,Robert White 74,2024-06-18 06:55:50-07:00,positive

Following a quick story for illustration:

Yesterday, one schedule was active, but I downloaded other apps to get lost. I was so immersed, that I put off socializing, eating, and basic chores. 

Until the sleep schedule from freedom kicked in, and stopped me from loosing my sleep too!

The other schedule starts 00:00 and go to 12 pm. This strict schedule, blocks even search engines.

Just those two things are magical: preserve my sleep, prevent my morning from spiraling.

The third schedule is always active. This one is less strict, but it still prevents me from straing from the path too deeply. Today, I added the apps I accessed yesterday to this list.

By doing this my focus time is more focused. My resting time become more restful. My days becomes more intentional, where I prioritize better and consequently live an overall better life.",5,câmber,2025-08-03 10:52:59-07:00,positive

,1269788228,,Freedom: Screen Time Control,"I hate the Recurring Mode so much (in locked mode).    If you set this for a future time, it automatically locks you out of all your websites and apps right away.   It doesn’t even wait for your scheduled time.    This is such a disaster.   

The 24 Hour ALL Day option on locked mode is an even bigger disaster.    This basically runs on a loop.  It doesn’t even give you an option to schedule days or weeks in advance.   It just does a 24 Hour never-ending loop.   

I also had to call the Help Desk several times this week because the app keeps double booking the same active session.  That means if you have it on Locked mode, you have to waste your one-time a week  cancellation just to get rid of the active session that you posted on accident.   

And even when your recurring session is over, they still have the recurring session actiivated again in the background when it should be cancelled.   

This can easily be fixed by letting us schedule the Locked mode in days instead of just hours on a never-ending loop.   This lets us reset our schedule when  our days are over.  

This app has the potential for 5 stars if you fix all these issues.     I will change my rating to 5 stars if you fix the recurring mode, allow us to set the timer in days, and stop the double booking and stop the recurring mode from running again after it has already ended.",2,Starcraft 1979,2025-03-06 05:52:32-07:00,negative

And it’s very carefully thought out. The teachings and meditations build on each other. It doesn’t have the scattershot feeling that seems to be common in meditation apps. Also, I don’t know which Tibetan teacher or teachers the creators of the app studied with, but their training comes across as deep. Really, using this app feels like belonging to a sangha with a great teacher. I hope the app store features this more prominently in U.S. searches for meditation apps.

,1303790148,,Brightmind Meditation,"Well, you have a large number of high ratings, which encourage me to try Brightmind. So, I tried the intro meditation, explaining to me why we learn mindfulness.
So far, so good. I have, shall we say, experienced meditations of many types, with an emphasis on mindfulness. 
The first problem, and I didn’t blame your app personally, is the price of membership. I am rated 100% disabled by the VA, due to my time in the armed forces, which means I’m unable to work. Again, not your fault, but as people you get than me like to say…” just sayin’”.
The other comment that bothered me is the first topic you addressed in your version of FAQs is that you do not use nature sounds in the background of any meditation. Your reasoning is something I cannot agree with.
I guess I’m one of “those people” that like nature. Mindfulness, as you correctly described, is training your self to be aware of subtle things , feelings, sounds, sensations, developing the “ mental muscle” to improve your cognitive ability to maleate your awareness, basically your life. I was attracted to Brightmind because it claimed to help you “ find happiness”. I’m thinking, He’ll yeah! Who doesn’t want to be happy?
I wanted you to know that this is meant to be a comment letter, not a hateful flame mail.
I also wish to point out that, because of the high level of work related stress in Japan, they developed a strategy which became a social trend, called” Forest Bathing”. Dr Sanjay Gupta, a neurosurgeon who sometimes appears on CNN, Fox, and runs a podcast, while still performing surgeries, went to visit Tokyo, Osaka, and other cities and provinces that I don’t recall the names. He was researching the area around the “Blue Zones”, which are areas on the planet where people tend to live past 100 years. Okinawa is on the list along with the Italian islands, and a few others. In Japan, people meet in a park in one of the Northern Perfectures of the main island of Japan. They test their cortisol level with strips of indicator paper, which folks can get in drug stores. They take notes of the reading. Then they take a hike through a heavily forested park in the mountains for 20-30 minutes. They return and retest their cortisol level. It dropped over twenty units( either mg or micrograms, I need to watch the documentary again.) since cortisol is a stress hormone that secretes into the body during chronic stress, it’s always good to keep it low.
Okay, I am finished, I just wanted to mention that maybe you might consider adding an option for people who like nature sounds. My mental faculties always seem sharper after my wife and I walk in our park. But, I realize there are people who might prefer silence.
I like both and have meditated both ways.

That said, for me Brightmind is far and away the most helpful because it is a coherent curriculum that provides a structured progression while also giving a wide variety of options. I had hit a plateau with my meditation practice and was on the verge of giving up. Shinzen Young’s “Unified Mindfulness”, which is the conceptual framework that underlies the app, provides tools that helped me find concentration, clarity, and equanimity in a far more powerful yet flexible way. 

Other apps, books, and methods seem to repeat the same (to me, stale) advice: “just return to your breath” with a haphazard mixture of voices and guidance saying mostly the exact same thing. 

Brightmind and Unified Mindfulness guided me through a series of very diverse approaches, allowing me to experiment and find a technique that works FAR better for me than watching my breath. I’m re-energized and committed in a transformed way.",5,Amesiowa,2019-07-09 03:38:53-07:00,positive

I am about halfway through and already plan to start over and include my tween and teens in order to introduce mindfulness to them at an earlier age than I’ve discovered it. Thank you to the developers for putting so much thought, research and heart into this app. And thank you for making it accessible.

Most surprising is how these benefits do not require hours in silence. Instead, they teach you how these practices can be done anywhere at anytime.

,1347447233,,TimeFinder: Time Blocking,"The beauty of TmeFinder is in its simplicity and ease of use.

UPDATE 11/01/24:  How can the best app keep getting better? I’m not sure, but it happens with every update!

📅 This app allows you to take control of your schedule. Other apps may boast of this, but in my experience, none are as simple or as user-friendly as this one.

🧠 What most impresses me about this app is its ability to manage my mind.  (Am I the only one who can relate to that meme about my mind being like an internet browser with 19 tabs open, 3 that are frozen, and no idea where the music is coming from?)

Thanks to TimeFinder, I can make quick work of scheduling my day (I have a list of routines saved for frequent tasks: get ready for work, commute, work, lunch break) while also making sure my To-Do lists get gone. The widget and Apple Watch notifications keep my on track throughout the day.

You know that awful feeling when you’re trying to go to sleep, but get flooded with a long list of things you need to do?  I even have a specific list dedicated to that. It’s not in a random place to be forgotten about, but it’s in TimeFinder where I can easily drag and drop it to my schedule as time allows and then mark it done— and I don’t mean figuratively.  A feature within TimeFinder allows you to mark tasks as done from within a list and as you complete it on the schedule. 

One word of caution: Because this app is so intuitive, you may think it a waste of time to view the video tutorial in the settings. You can easily navigate the app and get great benefit from it even if you don’t, but if you do watch it, you’ll get the scoop on some other great time-saving features that will maximize the overall benefit of the app.

If you have ADD and are tired of feeling guilty for frequently missing deadlines or important tasks due to lack of time because you’ve spiraled down a trail of hyper focusing on (mostly) trivial aspects of some other thing, this app is for you. Segmenting the day into manageable chunks that I can visually see has given me breathing room because I can know that I do have to time to accomplish these things. 

I thought the price seemed a bit steep at first, but having it sync between all devices is worth it, as it is so much easier to keep up with. But, while this is a great tool, it is still just a tool.

Location feature, if it works, (half the time it doesn't), may position your child somewhere off the coast of Africa. In the south Atlantic Sea.

It's difficult to determine days that are highlighted and days that aren't when determining schedules. 
Light shade, darker shade of pink? On off??
One of our four kids has an iPhone and he just turns it on and off at his convenience but that's not the apps fault. (and yes there's consequences for that behavior and internal features through the iPhone ((which is free)))
Notifications, when turned on, don't always give notifications. 
Sometimes notifications seem faulty or not accurate. 
I had arranged phone call with T-Mobile to talk about this app and have them walk me through an issue I was having. It's taking several calls to find somebody who knew the app enough to talk about it.
 After setting up an appointment for someone to call me, I was stood up.

,1348097043,,T-Mobile FamilyMode,"honestly i hate this. i may be biased as my parents used this to control my screen time and what i do on my phone— but i feel like there are way better options out there.
 
i’ll start by mentioning i do like a few parts of the app.  there’s a feature that lets u see ur child’s location, which may weird me out, but i definitely understand the need for it. i also like how it lets parents monitor their kids screen time, although i personally feel it takes it too far.
first of all, it shows every website and app you use or download to your guardian. this gives you rly little privacy, which is pretty frustrating especially for a child or teenager. in my experience, this feature scared me a lot as well; i was terrified my parents would use it to either belittle me for my interests or force me to get rid of games and such that i enjoyed. it also lets your parents specifically block you from viewing certain things, which prevented me from playing a mobile game made for children 9+ (as i said, i’m definitely biased, tho i do think i have some valid points!).
this is getting long, so i’ll end off by saying how this app and others like it can ruin the trust between children and parents. again, i’ll be speaking from my experience — my parents were always trying to control what i did both online and in person, which led to me having very little trust in them, and them using this app did not benefit that poor relationship. i feel like there are ways to monitor ur children and make sure they don’t view anything bad or inappropriate online without installing apps such as this.

tldr, although the app works as intended, i would not recommend it to others because it gives ur child little privacy and prevents you from building a trusting relationship w them.",2,katsfuneral,2024-03-21 18:21:21-07:00,negative

It’s kinda funny how many young children give bad reviews but if you are a concerned parent I would highly recommend this. Also PARENTS:: if you don’t want your kid to know every time u check their location or history disable notifications on their phone for this app specifically👍

While yes this app is good for your kids and you can see what they’re doing (which I think is good like it’s important to keep your kids safe), this app does have some technical issues that are pretty annoying(mostly on the child’s side). 

The biggest issue I have is that in the morning after bedtime mode has run out, the app will continuously tell me it is still bedtime mode. To fix this I have to turn wifi off, or turn airplane mode on, or both, or turn off my phone and back on again, and then turn airplane mode on and off because IT IS STILL ON BEDTIME MODE WHEN MINE SHOULD BE DONE. I usually spend 3mins OR MORE trying to get my phone to work it is very annoying. As someone who has time management issues it would be super helpful if this was fixed.

Supposedly, the changes I make are saving, but video ads, banners, and floating elements that follow as you scroll remain unblocked.

I will be canceling my subscription. Why pay for something that doesn’t work anymore?

Original review: Since updating to version 6.1.1, this app needs to download filters each time the app is opened. This seems to break something, as most of the time the app never loads.  The only fix is to kill the process and relaunch, which may or may not work.  Once it finally does load, it reapplies the same filters to Safari again, even though nothing has changed.

Who decided to code this behavior?

The good news is that filters still work, and most of the garbage on the internet is blocked. Disappointingly, nothing on YouTube gets blocked, so good luck with using that dumpster fire of a web site.

I started this app at 270 pounds and worried I couldn’t do any of the exercises because of my weight. But this app offered level 1 yoga that helped me get around some of my limitations and started me slow.  I’m now on my second round of a 28 day plan.  I had stopped about a month ago because I was struggling to balance so many other areas of my life that waking up at 5 am was becoming too difficult.  But this morning I woke up and started right where I left off. I didn’t think I would be able to, but the exercises are still simple enough my body remembered and I still felt good, but challenged.

What’s worse is when they would email me, they sent bits and pieces of information that was incomplete so I had to email them again for clear instructions.  

Most importantly, the app worked initially but stopped working.  It sends me explicit notices from my child’s phone when she isn’t even using it.  I let that nuisance go. Then my screen locked for my other child and they told me I had to upgrade controls which I never had to do when I initially installed the app or my daughter’s phone.  After upgrading, I had to give control to my computer (because you can only upgrade using a computer) and iPhone to FamiSafe. Now my phone does not work properly….it all of a sudden says VPN at the top and I can’t view the items in my email without removing VPN. If I remove VPN, then I don’t have access to the internet and I can’t download. After searching on the internet, I learned that FamiSafe is using VPN in order to run and has more access than I would like.

,1394150432,,everyday - Habit Tracker,"I’ve tried a lot of habit trackers, but there is almost always TOO much to fill in that it made me not want to use them. The process of filling everything in felt like it needed to be a habit in itself. 

My ADHD brain gets too distracted; I desperately wanted simplicity. After years, I’ve developed some great habits simply by using timers and reading Atomic Habits, which this app draws some concepts from. Now, I want to visualize this in a simple, easy-understand-visual for novice data folks like my wife or friends. So I turned to this app, (shout out r/dataisbeautiful). This app does just that. With intention and time, I’m excited to see what my visual will look like. Literally 3 click options:

-Did you do it? Tap.
-Did you do some of it? Tap.  Tap.
-Didn’t do it? Tap. Tap. Tap.

Obviously, there are things to fill out. But compared to others, IMO, set up is simple. Reminder options are available. There is even an option for breaking habits! 

Free to use, so I’ve testing with 3 habits and I’m very happy so far. It’s only 1/2, but so far, so good. 

Some improvements for this app, for me, would just be customizable user preferences. Specifically, visuals with fonts. I have unique reading needs so the ability to alter these helps a ton! This would help keep the app accessible for all. TY for your great app.",5,CasualDewm,2025-01-02 09:08:47-07:00,positive

Any changes I would suggest are minor. (Overlays to compare habits, for example.
A way to mark “data not recorded” as opposed to, “thing not done.”) 

I debated between 5 and 4 stars. I plan to stick with this tracker and hope it stays available long-term. The creator did a beautiful job.",4,MScrapp,2024-12-15 02:21:04-07:00,positive

Seeing my progress represented as a statistic helps me see and get motivated by progress

Also it’s very easy to stop/start habits. I often load on too many and realize I should only focus on a few
Also after I feel I’ve completed a habit, I can archive in case I want to come back to it.

,1405229961,,Ad Remover - Ad Blocker,"Super nice, and successful. I’m honestly such a big fan of this app. I wouldn’t use any other app at all, ever again. This is the holy grail of ad blockers. Seriously if you’re considering it, get the app. It’s well worth it. Everything works super well and clearly, barely and ads for me in the actual app. I am in love! I should have gotten this way sooner than I actually did. This is a life saver for me and everyone in my family! I’ve sent this to just about everyone I know and they all love it. Ad blockers are one of the best ways to help secure your privacy online, reduce clutter on websites, and avoid spyware-infected ads. Although it's certainly possible to find a paid ad blocking software, there's no reason to spend money on one. Most of the best ad blockers are completely free to use and this is one of them! This app is good for blocking DNS requests from a large list of servers that are involved with malware, spyware, adware, and tracking. This means that you can’t interact with a dangerous websites unless you manually change your settings to give it access.
One of the things that makes this feature special is that it can protect you even if you are already infected by malware. It blocks communications from dangerous servers, which stops malware from following through with dangerous activities. The best apps help you get more out of your smartphone or tablet purchase. They are the lifeblood of your iOS or Android devices that provide fun when you're bored, function when you have stuff to do, and have the potential to change how you use your tech.

,1405229961,,Ad Remover - Ad Blocker,"On my first use I was sceptical I have used other blockers with no success I was bombarded with ad after ad. A friend of mine told me about this app and how good it worked. After about a week I finally downloaded the app and it works! I no longer have to see ads of celebrity drama or someone trying to sell me something it’s ridiculous how many ads there are on the internet ad after ad it was stressful on my mind body and soul. I just wanted to be able to search a topic without a ad isn’t that only fair shouldn’t that be a human right. Well unfortunately it isn’t we are subject to ads day and night. So I am taking a stand and this app is helping me take my power back. If you’re interested don’t be afraid go ahead just try I assure you won’t be disappointed you deserve this app you deserve a app that works. Don’t fall victim to the okey doke take a stand with me.  This app really does work believe me I didn’t at first but now I am a believer and I want to share the good news. I am so thankful that I can be ad free I hate ads and they are so taking of my time and energy no one should have to be forced to see ads day n and day out. What a world but I have the answer I have the key I have my power back I am totally amazed and excited.

,1405229961,,Ad Remover - Ad Blocker,"Ad Remover Ad Blocker truly is fantastic. I have always had a genuine dislike for annoyingly aggressive ads and pop ups. Yeah I know I just searched for some shoes on Amazon I don’t need a reminder and no I don’t want to play a fantasy game. I can really say that I am so glad that I finally came across this app when I did. I was fed up with ads constantly popping up while I am search for something in Safari and other browsers like Chrome. The sad part about it is that they usually occur most frequently while I am doing something important like working or doing homework. Now that I have Ad Remover - Ad Blocker that is a thing of the past (poof good bye ads lol). I will say that I am extremely thankful for the developers of this amazing app. I would have probably pulled my hair out by now otherwise. That is just truly how much I despise ads and pop ups. In light of all the ups the only downside to the app is that it does not allow me to turn it off on certain site. Unless I just over looked that feature (I looked pretty hard by the way). If someone know lad any different please let me know I hate to leave this life save with four stars for something so simple. But it wouldn’t be an honest review otherwise. Hope everyone else enjoys it as much as I do.

,1405229961,,Ad Remover - Ad Blocker,"This app blocks every ad while you're in Safari. While it doesn't block in-app ads nearly as much, I've noticed it definitely cuts down on the quantity of those ads as well, so maybe that's a beneficial side effect even though it's not supposed to. If you watch YouTube in Safari, you won't get anymore of those pesky ads prior to your video. The app is simple to use, and has a pleasing user interface. The only thing that isn't very appealing is the lack of dark mode in the app, but that could be added in the future. Otherwise, the app is very nice to look at and is extremely simple to use to. Just tap one button and all of your Safari ads will be gone. If you've ever used an ad blocker on your desktop computer, you know how useful those can be, and this app works just as well. If you have a limited data plan, this helps filter out unnecessary junk ads that only waste your data by showing you information and offers you don't care about. It's also a necessity for privacy as well. Ads track everything you do on the internet, and the only way to get around that is with a quality ad blocker that stops those ad providers from seeing what you're watching or what items you've been looking at online. If you're Internet connection is slow and usually requires a long time to load up everyday pages, this ad blocker will help as it will get rid of content that just slows down your internet speeds. This app is a necessity for anyone who uses the internet, and it will make your browsing experience significantly more fluid.

,1405229961,,Ad Remover - Ad Blocker,"This ad blocker is great. It works quietly in the background with an intricate level of security. Gone are all the pop ups and pesky advertising.  Those auto play videos are halted too.  In addition to blocking ads this is equipped with many other features such as privacy protection.  The frustration and headache is eliminated now, and I can search the web and work in peace.   I especially like running this as I stream videos. Some streaming outlets normally run ads about every 10 minutes into a video.  This app successfully shuts that nonsense off.  

A couple of things I have also noticed with Ad remover is my Page load time has improved. It also appears that my bandwidth usage has been reduced.  Ads are no longer eating up RAMs.   A lot of times I would accidentally click on ads and be sent to a new page. That stops here so my user experience on the net has improved immensely.   This app also cuts out unnecessary exposure to malware attacks.  

One of the neat things I’ve noticed about iOS 13 using Safari is that the browser app can process the list of what to block before the page even loads. The result? Much faster page load times iOS 13 users who've downloaded this app.

As long as you keep this app running you will continue blocking ads, tracking codes, and other third-party scripts that benefits users by increasing page load times, improving battery life, and protecting privacy. Not to mention, you know it’s eliminating the annoyance of interruptive ads.

All in all, I must say these developers have done a great job covering all the bases and this is a solid app.

,1405229961,,Ad Remover - Ad Blocker,"To begin, Ad blockers in general are one of the best ways to help secure your privacy online, reduce clutter on websites, and avoid spyware-infected ads. Although it’s certainly possible to find a paid ad blocking software, there’s no reason to spend money on one. Most of the best ad blockers are completely free to use. With that said, this Ad is the BEST! It’s 14 day free-trial is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Such a simple concept. Not only are there multiple types of advertisements you might run into, there are multiple ways to block advertisements. Ultimately, how an ad-blocker goes about blocking ads does not matter so much as long as it doesn’t impede your ability to effectively browse the web and doesn’t invade your privacy. Additionally, a good ad blocker will block most types of ads. This app here is no different! I am extremely satisfied with this service because I can finally surf the internet without the annoying pop-up ads! I’d 100% recommend installing this app!! This application does exactly what it implies... it blocks ads! Pretty much all of them! Banner ads? Yes! Those annoying Flash ads that seem to be popping up everywhere? You hey! Facebook ads, Google ads, pop-up ads? Check, check, and check! Using this application basically results in the practical advantage of faster page loads, which pleasantly surprised me! This app is also pretty straight forward. Install it, run the application, go about your internet browsing, and ads will seem as if they are a thing of the past. To conclude, this app, for me (and for you too) is very effective and beneficial, easy to use, and I highly recommend anyone seeking a smoother, less cluttered Web-Browsing experience!

,1414802569,,Serenity: Guided Meditation,I’ve tried so many meditation apps and this is the first I feel like I can stick with. I love the simplicity of the app. It’s very straightforward with a clean UI. With other apps I felt overwhelmed by the amount of content or the way it was organized in the app to get to the content I was interested in. Because I’m new at meditation I really like that the guided mediations are helpful and also 10 min. Any more than 10 and I’d be too overwhelmed to try. They also offer mini mediations that are less than 5 min. I also love that they give you actual free content that’s useful. And for those of you who are tired of paying a subscription you’ll love (like i do) that you can choose to unlock everything with a one time payment. In the end I actually chose the very reasonably priced 6 month subscription to try out more of the sleep sections and stress relief sections. But if I stick with it I will definitely upgrade to the one time payment. This app made it easy for me to want to support by upgrading.

I accidentally start flows all the time, and I need my study time to be as accurate as possible for future references. Accidentally right-clicking is my problem. But, this app is still fantastic.

Second, which is not a very big deal but the syncing from apple watch to the phone app does not seem to work that well. I could be on my 4th pomodoro on the watch but the app says I did nothing.

Thanks to the Apple Watch I’ve had my phone on spent for years, all alerts distilled down to little taps on my wrist. It’s weird to me that an app in 2023 that’s otherwise so polished doesn’t do this. I can’t remember the last time an app had sound-only alerts, it’s a little bizarre.

Second, sessions don't sync across devices in real time so there's no way to start the timer on my mac and see the time left on my apple watch or phone. Also, there should be an option to adjust the volume of the ticking sound and the option to use ambient noises during sessions (white noise, rain, etc.) Other than that, really love this app!",4,emeterioso,2023-02-03 10:11:26-07:00,neutral

The floating timer ""gamifies"" the experience for me, pomodoro style. A 25-min challenge feels achievable! And I'm pleasantly surprised how much I've accomplished at the end of the day.

Suggestion to the developer(s) for a future release: when looking at my weekly analytics, it would be great to dig deeper... to see the names of each of my flows from the past to measure how much time I'm dedicating to certain projects.

,1423210932,,Flow - Focus & Pomodoro Timer,"I’ve been using this timer for a few days now and so far I do really like it. But there are some things that I would probably like to see changed. 

First there is a setting that says “hide window what timer starts” I have this checked but it doesn’t seem to work? I still have to press the X for it to exit out. I would really prefer if there was an option to not have the window pop up at all and everything was just done from the menu bar. And maybe that option is there and I don’t have my settings right?? But I’ve gone through them multiple times now and I don’t see anything that changes this. 

The other thing, and this is more of an add on, but it would be nice to have a small list or a way to name the current flow to the task you’re working on. That way it keeps that task at hand and in mind. I would use the “show session title in the menu bar icon” setting if I could in face customize the session title to something relevant that I’m doing.

Anyways the biggest issue is the fact that the window needs to be manually exited out. If it didn’t pop up at all that would be ideal for me. But if it actually automatically hid itself like the setting suggests, I’d be happy with that.",3,KaosityReign,2024-12-12 10:16:17-07:00,neutral

,1436994560,,Portal - Escape Into Nature,"I really love this app; I'm a studen in University and I can now be taken back to a class I was studying for by hearing one of these soundscapes, which is a really interesting experience to say the least. What I really use Portal for, however, is to sleep. 
After listening to a podcast about the Amazon rainforest, I now go to sleep listening to ""Twilight rainforest"" in St. Lucia. 
When I read fiction, I always put on that ""Spring Barley Field"" and it takes me straight into fairytale land. 
When I want white noise like sound for sleep or focus, why not do it in beautiful ""Ama Dablam"" in Nepal, or my all time favorite ""Highlands Snow"" in Scotland (seriously this one is just perfect).
I've woken up to ""Fingle Woods"" birds chirping so much that I once was kind of confused where I was when I woke up.
And then, there's Stuart Chan at Portal, who's the goat. They hooked me up with the beta for Mac so I could try it early and ""help out"" by using it and find bugs (little do they know they were the ones helping me hehe). Speaking of, any bugs I did find Stuart instantly responded to and it was fixed so quickly.

Yes, it's expensive, and I'll be sad when my year subscription ends come november - because I'm in my final year of university and I need all the spare change I can get. But as soon as I'm able, I plan on putting my money where my mouth is, and I suggest you do too (on your mouth that is, I don't want your money on my mouth).

I've used Portal on my iPhone for a couple of years, projecting it to my Homepod for pleasant morning birdsong and water lapping on the shores of Lake Bled, or Triglav thunderstorms for a soothing night's sleep; I've even taken the birds of Fingle Woods with me on my walks while I simultaneously listen to a podcast or audiobook.

But the desktop app brings a whole new dimension to the experience. I'm mesmerized by the beauty of the video taking over my desktop background in its gentle, near-seamless loop. It's a window into the outside world—any outside world that you want right now. Is it a river? A waterfall? A beach? A field? A rainy forest? Portal has brought my mind to a whole new place of focus and productivity I hadn't felt for some time. I adore it. This is a uniquely poignant and important productivity tool, the true missing piece in the remote worker's arsenal. You might try mixing it with music, too—I always love a good afternoon Lo-Fi listen—and see where your focus takes you.

I've been in contact with the team behind Portal, and they're a pleasure to talk with. They take feedback sincerely and their craft seriously. I can't wait to see what they bring to Portal next!",5,bssmithy,2023-08-15 15:56:08-07:00,positive

This app and the various scenes are amazing in sound and visual quality.  I like the increasing variety presented (I love the storms, fireside, and forest sounds the most, though the lava ones are a surprising new favorite), and look forward to more places and soundscapes and app versions in the future (Yule log?

A few weeks ago a student invited me to this app, it’s so good it solved all of the issues I had with the other apps , but here is some point to improve it: 

 1. Unlimited Group members , why is only 50 members, I got like 300 students in my class , how would compete with all of them. At least make it like 200 or 300 members. 

 2. Glitches, why when I open the app it takes like 2 or 3 seconds to open the home page. Idk is it an animation thing or something else but whenever u stop the timer or change some settings, it takes like a sec to get action done. I don’t mind it that much but this could make a lot of iPhone users Not happy with experience. 

3. plz add the option to set ur own time study start, why is always start at 5am . I start at 1 am so plz give us the option.

”Why more than 900,000 users choose Daily Habit Tracker?

1. Unlimited amount of habits. You don’t need to pay a penny to start building as many habits as you need.
2. Ad-free. We hate ads & don’t want to bother our users”

Here’s how that went: 
- Opened the app
- Greeted with a prompt to pay for premium. 
- Dismissed the prompt. 
- Premium prompt pops up again.
(“Hmm.. that’s kind of annoying..”)
- Dismissed the prompt again.
- Started creating my first habit.
- Tried to change the color.
- Premium prompt pops up again.
- Dismissed a third time.
- Finished creating habit (minor complaint here; you can’t set the frequency to more than once a day, e.g. twice a day).
- Created two more habits.
- Tried to create a fourth.
- Premium prompt pops up again.
- Dismissed a fourth time.
(“Surely that’s a mistake..? I was promised unlimited habits, for not even a penny.”)
- Tried to create a fourth habit.
- Premium prompt pops up again.
- Dismissed a fifth and final time.
- Uninstalled.

To be fair, the interface is pretty nice and polished. Please correct me if I’m stupid and missing something obvious, but why can’t I create more than 3 habits? I thought this app could help me structure my day and hold me accountable with reaching my goals. I don’t need an app to remind me of a maximum of 3 things.

I can write some scathing reviews & you want to force me to write a review about your app after frustrating the daylights out of me?

You seriously want to rile me into the mindset to go there by forcing a review when you could have waited, not been pushy or devious & gotten a future GOOD review?  
Just saying…be careful what you wish for.

I use my watch exclusively and is it difficult to watch the countdown, which I really do not want to do anyway.  I would love to see an alert like when the rest time is over.

Another thing that makes the app stand out is how it’s an adorable game as well! I love to play it a lot, and it’s not addicting (I try my best to avoid addicting games)! Planting and taking care of all of your super cute plants is just an awesome experience. I really enjoy expanding my gardens, opening chests to reveal more gardeners, and getting to join a group. The app in general is just so cute and you can get two things at once: a great game and less screen time. 

One thing I would really like, though, would probably be a chat feature in the groups. It would be really fun to get to chat to the other members in the group, and we could feel closer to each other and help out.

,1465713447,,Declutter The Mind Meditation,"I’ve been calling on The Lord for help for some time now, I’m 29 and been abusing weed for over 12 years. (Abusing and smoking are 2 different things) I smoked every morning before work, during, and a lot more after for years. 
I took a day (kinda hard) to clean my mind without smoking for once, and I called to The Lord again and started to realize I need to love myself before others cause I’ve never been happy with me, yet I was trying to help and please others. 
So I googled “how to be happy” and this app came up. 
With the help of God, I started to use this app to try to meditate for a change. I’m a dude so I thought it was more of a female thing for some stereotypical reason. 
But this app points out what bothers most people and has all kinds of categories to help. 
I got the free version, I don’t like to spend money on apps so I’m not saying buy anything from it, but the free advice and meditation guide that helps you learn it is really a game changer in my life. Along with music, positive mind set and of course Christs love for us. You have to call on God first and the rest will be all good man. 
Try to app out if you’ve been a depressed pothead for years. May be too soon to speak but I’ve used less than a hour of this apps time and I feel great.

,1465713447,,Declutter The Mind Meditation,"When current meditation running you can’t go back on home screen and explore or see other episodes while current one running in background. 

Headspace is like once you played then it load full 30 min episode and then whether you are in WiFi or cellular network or break in network it doesn’t stop and continuously run in background for 30 min. So no frustration to hit play again and again if that interrupts due to breaking of network. 

There should be a way to keep mediation offline. Because there is no point of running same episode everyday over network. It stress servers and contribute global warming. I know might be less revenue generating but overall helpful for the world. 

They can charge $0.99 for premium service with features. Affordable and may be people will buy more subscription rather expensive one less. 99 cents hit buy. 10$ let me think it is worth? Oh wait there may be better service! Oh no it’s not worth 10$ let’s cancel. So why not just 99 cents and bingo done.

These posts were “internet safety 101 cyber bullying and trolls” and one aimed at letting people know the app was being ran by Ross.

In the cyber bullying post, I spoke about what had just happened.
And it was prompted, removed.
As if someone was hiding it-
Along with that, comments I was reading on earlier posts talking about the same man- also disappeared.

This man. Is hiding his actions and abusing his power by revealing sensitive information.

I still have snaps of what he did, and I might take legal action depending on the damages.",1,Artsiefrog,2025-09-29 12:16:44-07:00,negative

For the visual, I find it very pleasing as it’s not minimalistic and plain boring. The art is very aesthetically pleasing and I can tell efforts were put into this.
For the interface, beginners can instantly pick up where they need to start. The timer allows you to set however long you want your work session to be. You can also set your rest time to however you want. Compare to Focus Keeper, I think it’s overrated because you have to pay just to change the intervals of timers.
In addition, while you are working, the app gives you a variety of options to play ambient sounds in the background; Works even if you exit the app! There are also no ads in for this background noise!
Which brings me to my last point, that this is all free and has no ads in them! I believe that putting ads would ruins the whole atmosphere this app is intended to created.
Bonus: You have an option to upgrade to Tomato King permanently for $2! Just $2. Even though I may not use the data feature a lot, I’ll buy it to support the creator of this app for their creativity and the vast utility this app has to offer. 🌞",5,Me291537911,2021-08-29 07:49:25-07:00,positive

The only thing I would suggest is a tagging system for categorizing focus times and breaks quickly. From there, maybe more advanced statistics showing you a pie chart or bar breakdown of how you spent your recorded time that day. Statistics as they are are OK.

FitMind gives you the researched back science up front and then teaches you how to use it. It’s truly a system to rewire your brain. It’s not a question of will this work for me, it’s a statement that this does in fact work you just need to be open and committed. For me any level of progress inspires me to learn more. To be eager for more, hungry for more and that has made all the difference in the world.

Liam your dedication to this system, the level of research you have done, how you have presented it. the commitment you have made is absolutely outstanding. I’m 10 days in and I’m blown away by how much I been able to reframe my thoughts. Years of negative thinking patterns and behaviors that I have struggled for so long to overcome are actually being recoded. This is insane.

So if you are on the fence let me tell you that you have nothing to lose and so much to gain.

I hope this message finds you well.
I am a lifetime subscriber of your amazing app, and I truly appreciate the features and design you provide. However, I am facing difficulties using some of the features due to the lack of Arabic language support.

As a native Arabic speaker with limited English proficiency, I often struggle to fully understand certain parts of the app, which prevents me from benefiting from its full potential. I believe that adding Arabic as a supported language would make a significant difference for many users like myself in the Arab world.

I kindly request you to consider including Arabic language support in future updates. This would greatly enhance accessibility and improve the user experience for a large portion of your global audience.

Thank you for your time and continued efforts in developing such a helpful app.

Warm regards,

,1478345385,,Study Bunny: Focus Timer,"I got this app to help me study for my tests, and it does not disappoint! 
People are always ranting, saying, ‘*Oh, thEsE Ads ArE sO AnnOYIng I’m gOnnA dElEtE thE App >:(‘but they aren’t even that frequent. They act like they interrupt the study session that your having. If you were just chilling, reading over a chapter in a digital textbook, zoning out to some Lofi beats, and then BAM, Mattress ad pops on at full volume, then yes, I would rate this lower and write about it, but that surely isn’t the case. 
My one issue, (not that it’s a big one) is the PRICE of the items/background in the shop. Let me paint you a picture 🎨 🖌️ 🖼️ 🌈; One coin for ten minutes, Two for twenty, and so forth. I do online school, so I average about… 40 minutes per day. That’s four coins. You wanna know how much the least expensive items are? 10. You wanna know how much the MOST are? 1,000. I’m sorry, WHAT!? That is absolutely ridiculous. *No person is going to sit and study for 10 hours a day to be able to get some items in 10 days. At least, no one I know.
All in all, this app does its job and is a great study motivator/timer.

I often times made lists that were lengthy and unorganized which resulted in me feeling overwhelmed or discouraged when I didn’t finish everything. So I went on the hunt for an app to help motivate me and this app is exactly what I’ve been looking for!

Not only is this app super cute, it’s so easy to use! I love the simplicity of it and how customizable it is to fit everyone’s unique tasks, goals or habits as they came them in the app. I tried a few other apps and in comparison I found that Avocation really motivated me to stay on track and organize my daily habits so I can accomplish them easily. Plus, the cute characters make it fun! My favorite thing about the app is the creative freedom they give by letting you customize your habit entirely with your own title, color, days of the week and time of day.

I would highly recommend! You can download the app for free to try it out and see how you like it. It limits how much you can do in the free experience but honesty, it’s worth the $10 (one time purchase for lifetime benefits) to not only get all the features of this beautiful app but also support the creators who clearly are making this app to help others. A one time payment for all the benefits of the app?? It’s very affordable and generous of the creators! Most apps I tried will charge you monthly or yearly!

One suggestion I’d like to make: It would be awesome if the habits were organizable! I love that they are separated by morning, afternoon and evening but currently the habits in each section stay in order by creation. So it would be nice to have a filter option to sort them by specific time, type of habit or importance or to be able to drag the habit bubbles to be in a custom desired order.",5,smellyjones,2022-07-21 06:12:09-07:00,positive

The routines, the ability to set a duration of time and then set the end time and the app would automatically set the start time. THAT is precisely what my neurodivergent brain NEEDS and that is exactly what I paid for. But it was taken away I keep waiting for them to bring it back but instead they keep adding things that I don’t need. I don’t need to see HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW on the To-Do list. Or at least give the ability to turn those off, it’s very distracting. 
Ohhh, and I doesn’t sync across devices, you have to load each calendar for each device. 
The only thing I use is the Focus Timer so I can visually see how much time I have left (mostly getting ready to go somewhere) and this only works if I’ve done the math correctly to begin with because that’s one of the features that were taken away. Ohhh how I wish I could get my money back!!! 

My previous review Aug 10, 2025:
DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! 

It’s been a little over three months since I wrote my original review and nothing has improved. I am beyond frustrated because this app no longer has the features that made me decide to fork over $59! I don’t need or want AI, I want to be able to plan my day with routines (no longer a feature) and to reverse plan my day (also no longer available). They say they’re “committed to supporting executive functioning and daily planning in the best possible way” but all I see them committed to is taking people’s money. And yes, there is a weekly/monthly overview on the web planner but it only shows events that are directly in your iCal or Google calendar, and if you are subscribed to other calendars, they don’t show up on the web planner. So the web planner is basically useless. Bottom line; DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!

My previous review May 6, 2025:
Used to be perfect, now it’s just a mess.

Well, close to perfect. I paid the lifetime fee for this app and I wasted my money! I used to be able to do reverse scheduling; my appointment is at 1:15, I like to give myself 15 minutes arrival time to park and get inside so I would set the task for 15 min duration and the end time for 1:25 and the app would automatically set the start time. Same for travel time, 40 minutes to get there, set duration then the end time and app would set the start time. I’d plan my whole day this way. BUT now this feature is no longer there. I have to do the time math myself and if I’m wrong I could be late. I love the visual timer but it’s useless to me if I’m not on time. The main reason I purchased this VERY EXPENSIVE app was for the task duration and ability to plan my day backwards. 

There are many more features that would improve this app like the ability to glance at the week, or drag/drop multiple tasks when an appointment gets rescheduled, the ability to leave a comment (not a note) in the task, but I could (and did) live without these things. HOWEVER, I NEED the task duration returned!!!!

,1480220328,,Tiimo: AI Planner & To-do,"I can’t express what Tiimo is to me as an app and the degree to which it has changed my life. I encourage every neurodivergent person I know to try it. I have struggled my entire life with time blindness and staying current with my self care routines. I am a person who desperately needs routines to function but has trouble maintaining them. I built my routines into the app and add them to my schedule daily and it helps me figure out more than any other tool I’ve tried how to carve out that time for myself. I also am able to create much more realistic goals for myself because it forces me to think about how much time things actually take. Setting realistic goals and not over scheduling myself has lead to a greater sense of accomplishment that in turn encourages me to accomplish more. I also have been more on time to things than I have ever been. I end every day with the review function and plan out the next day. It helps me so much with the paralysis I’ve always felt when deciding what to do and what is most important to prioritize. Also, this app is created by the most incredible team. They are not just pumping this app out here- they legitimately deeply care about their mission to create a productivity app for neurodivergent people. I heard about an upcoming feature change that I used heavily and was concerned. I sent them a loooong email not expecting to hear back. They not only responded but helped me to understand the change and work through what it would mean for me. They went above and beyond to help me feel comfortable (because as we know, neurodivergent people can struggle with change.)

,1480220328,,Tiimo: AI Planner & To-do,"I’ve been using Tiimo for over a year now, and I have to say the updates since my last review have been really great. A lot of the things I mentioned before actually feel like they were taken into consideration.

What I love most is that the app keeps its simplicity, but still allows for creativity. I can customize my layout to fit my style without feeling overwhelmed by too many options. The built-in color schemes are vibrant without being “too much,” which makes it fun and motivating to use.

I especially appreciate how the day is divided into morning, day, and evening sections, which keeps things from feeling cluttered. The drop-down lists are another favorite—being able to expand or shorten them makes my schedule feel manageable.

One of the biggest highlights for me has been the new AI integration. I actually suggested this in my original review, so seeing it added was amazing! It’s still new and could be expanded, but it’s already a great feature that makes planning easier.

Since these updates, I’ve been using Tiimo more consistently, and I can honestly say it helps me stay on track throughout the day.

A few things I’d love to see in the future:
	•	More adaptations to the AI features.
	•	A true home screen view—being able to see tasks and check them off directly from my home screen without fully opening the app would be so helpful.
	•	A way to schedule travel time between activities, so that “empty space” actually reflects the time I spend driving or transitioning, not just free time.

Overall, Tiimo is still my favorite ADHD/autism-friendly planner. It’s colorful, simple, and motivating, and I can see it only getting better from here.",5,Ciera.Johnson3,2025-08-28 06:25:42-07:00,positive
,1480220328,,Tiimo: AI Planner & To-do,"This app has been so helpful for me. I don’t have ADHD, but I am pretty forgetful, so creating my routines helps me not only stay on track but remember everything I have to do. I think the paid version is worth it, and I needed the paid version to create custom repeats for events. Speaking of that, there’s a weird glitch when creating repeats where the day that you select doesn’t align with the day that it creates the repeated event. Either some trial and error I figured out which day is which. There are some other minor glitches, but overall this is exactly what I was looking for. It’s a great combination between a routine/habit tracker and a calendar.",5,3wishes16,2025-01-06 05:53:10-07:00,positive

,1480220328,,Tiimo: AI Planner & To-do,"I didn’t think that any productivity app could help put me on a path that would lead to my dreams coming true. Yet the techniques and lessons I learned from using Tiimo have helped me to build the skills in such a way that I now do most thing out of habit and need the app less and less. 

That right there is pure magic and should be the point of all apps that are focused on helping people become more organized and especially when they are designed as thoughtfully as Tiimo; with the neurodivergent community in mind. Don’t miss out on the videos and how to tools in the app as they can really teach you things you thought you knew but really could benefit from learning more about. 

I found myself more successful in using Tiimo due to some of the quality of life perks such as the ability to utilize colors and emojis in interface that make it easier for my brain to sort and process the information it is seeing.

It’s essential features like this that help set Tiimo apart from the rest. I also very much appreciate the ability to have multiple profiles. As someone with multiple disabilities and varying needs in my day to day life, I value being able to switch profiles so that I can access different sets of daily tasks.

Not every productivity or organizational app is for everyone, but the flexibility provided by Tiimo means that I’m confident you’ll find something beneficial from giving it a download and trial run.

,1482225056,,Joon: Kids ADHD Chore Tracker,"1. Heads up: unless you are going to assign 7 or fewer tasks per day, don't bother downloading this. The app strings you along and lets you believe you'll be able to use its basics for free. It DOES pester you nonstop to upgrade/subscribe, but you can opt out initially. You get this all set up, the kid's game app installed, and your kid invested in using it, and THEN after the 7th completed task, it hits you with the subscription requirement to keep using it. Very aggravated at the old bait and switch tactics and will be uninstalling. 
2. Additionally: For an app that is supposed to help keep a kid on track, why on earth are there a myriad of extra coin-earning tasks built in that keep the kid indefinitely on the app doing random things instead of helping them focus on executing the tasks assigned by the parent?

,1482225056,,Joon: Kids ADHD Chore Tracker,"If you’re a parent looking for a fun, engaging, and productive way to help your child stay on top of daily tasks and build better habits, the Joon Kid App is a must-try. This app turns to-do lists into an interactive game where kids take care of a virtual pet called a “Doter,” and every real-world task they complete helps their pet grow and thrive.

What I loved:
	•	Gamified Motivation: The game-like approach makes chores and routines exciting. My child actually looks forward to brushing teeth or doing homework just to earn rewards in the app.
	•	Parental Controls: The parent dashboard is easy to use and allows me to assign tasks, monitor progress, and approve completed activities.
	•	Positive Reinforcement: Instead of constant reminders, my child now feels ownership over their daily responsibilities. The app rewards consistency, effort, and good habits.
	•	Educational Angle: It subtly encourages time management, independence, and goal-setting skills.

What could improve:
	•	Some customization options are limited (e.g., not all tasks are editable in detail).
	•	It’s more effective for younger kids (around ages 5-7); older children might find it less appealing.
	•	There’s a subscription cost, which may not work for every family’s budget—but there is a free trial to test it out.

,1501720596,,Qustodio Parental Control App,"Pro:
Easy and quick to install on devices, also doesn’t show the install icon or app on any of the devices.
Accurate, detailed and quick updates sent to the parents instantly. 
App is fairly easy to navigate. 

Cons:
There should be separate restrictions for each device under each child. For example: I had to create an entire different profile for the children’s school computers to block all gaming and YouTube, whereas their phones and gaming computers have different rules, obviously. 

The section for ” daily time limit” simply doesn’t work.  It may block the internet and say “time is up” but it doesn’t block my son playing fortnite or Roblox on his gaming PC because technically their Microsoft apps, same with the internet “instant freeze” option - it does not stop his internet for the gaming on his PC, only the internet browser so that’s basically useless. The ONLY feature that seems to work well is the restricted time grid, this completely locks them out of their devices. HOWEVER, this causes a problem with their iPhones, and using WhatsApp for emergencies so I then need to create a separate profile for their iPhones.  As it sits, each child has their own profile and then they have a profile for their iPhones and a profile for their school devices, this is silly - you should be able to create custom rules for each device linked to the child profile, not a blanket profile for all devices. With their iPhones the parental settings included with your Apple ID function much easier than this app, so just use that for their iPhones unless you want to see exactly what they’re using their phone for, then this app is your spy.  

Lastly, my one child’s profile shows she is constantly online, it shows her time usage as 24 hours a day - even when her device is off, so there must be some bugs to work out. I contacted support and have yet to hear back.",3,Panamum,2023-11-18 17:30:46-07:00,negative

It would be much better to allow easy access the things you already purchased and place them at the top of the homepage. The Mission of Chopra and the Chopra Center is honorable; however, the developers of the Chopra app are not client focused, they simply want to sell you more stuff! There is room for significant improvement with some very minor changes by simply coming from a customer service focused frame of mind. The simple question should be asked, what could benefit the customer the most? Rather than the curtain frame of mind, which is, “what can we sell them next?”

Enlightenment starts with leading by example and I encourage the Chopra app design staff to listen to what Chopra teaches, so they can do a better job on future app design updates. 

Lead by example. 🙏😊

,1504538204,,InnerNow: Meditation & Joy,"Been a purchaser of the 21 day meditations and a follower of Chopra. This app is buggy-buggy to a frustrating point that in truth, seems to defeat the purpose of meditating.

Here’s what you will encounter:
Not many meditations with Chopra.

App will forget you are a subscriber and lock you out frequently. (Keep refreshing the app to solve)

App won’t remember your last “place” in a series.
(I’ve had it for 4 months and it is stuck on what I did on day 2 of usage.)

Sometimes the app will take your subscription $$ but still not allow you in. (Contact customer service and eventually they will say to reinstall the app.)

Your prior purchases won’t be in the app. You will be directed to the website to listen to those.

Searching for anything is difficult and not at all designed intuitively.

Your choice. Insight Timer has none of these issues. I come to Chopra for a different vibe every once in a while and keep the frustration to a minimum.

Last note: several of these issues have been going on for 2 years or more per other reviews, with promises to fix. Just remember to “stay peaceful in your core” and I suggest the mantra “Om” for the familiar “something went wrong” message.",2,Maggieb.com,2023-03-02 12:27:00-07:00,negative

,1506160130,,Purity - Porn Block Browser,"I have long said “If only there was a text-only browser for mobile!” Well, here it is. It gives you a black- and white-list option, as well as the option to add the email of an accountability partner, and a 4-digit pin to lock the settings. It does not take screenshots of your phone, but analyzes the text of your search words and of the web pages for risky/dangerous behavior.

And it works. Sometimes a little too well- for example, it will block some Intuit pages because they include the phrase “yandex”. But by and large I can get done what I need done. Thankful to these folks for enabling me to have access to the internet for research and work, without the temptation of porn, or even of reading sensual stories. 

To Purity - thank you. Please don’t cave to the inevitable pressure of users who say “this would be perfect, if only we could also do X, Y, or Z”. The world needs a barebones text-based browser just like Purity is now. I get that some changes might be good, but you have a simple app that works. More complexity lends itself to more bugs and issues. 

To other users - this app works really well in tandem with the Screen Time restrictions on iPhones, if you want to really dial in safety on your phone. Set your safety settings in Purity and Screen Time, then have a trusted friend/accountability partner set the 4-digit pins for both Purity and Screen Time.

,1506160130,,Purity - Porn Block Browser,"I think overall this is a reall good browser with a affordable price as well, my only critique of it is that seems to block sites that have absolutely nothing to do with pornography. For example I tried to access a website to look at my 401k and that was blocked or just trying to put in a job application and it was blocked. It ends up making me go back to regular browsers just to get some simple tasks done.

,1506160130,,Purity - Porn Block Browser,"This app is great for resisting temptation, it will block URLs that you blacklist and any specific words you want blacklisted in URLs. It is in Google Safe Search by default and is great for blocking very specific sites or searches in specific sites. This is great and has been very helpful.

The positives sadly stop there. This browser is slow and very clunky, taking a considerable amount of time to load web pages even on a newer phone with great connection. The main issue though, is that if you have a specific URL blacklisted, it will block that URL even if it is a back link somewhere on the page. For example, if I have Twitter blocked, it will load a web page until it realizes there is a link for a company’s Twitter account somewhere on the page, then it will send an alert and stop loading the page. This app and its blocking algorithm does not take into account URLs that are linked to a web page, it just sees them and automatically blocks the page. You can imagine how frustrating it is to try and load a web page but it is blocked because the author has a link to their social media at the bottom of the page.

Although this app will help you fight temptation and that is the ultimate goal, it is slow, filled with errors like the example given above, and poorly optimized. I am actively looking for a replacement because of these issues.",1,Jonah Nathaniel,2024-06-19 07:17:01-07:00,negative

Don’t let this be a reason that stops you if you are looking for a good choice of browser, but it is a little hard to navigate as the browser isn’t buttery smooth sometimes it’s hard clicking, moving things around, navigating and zooming.

,1506160130,,Purity - Porn Block Browser,"No content blocker is perfect— there’s almost always a workaround. We tend to find what we’re after if we look hard enough. Chances are, if you’ve been in the fight for years or decades now, you know plenty of terms and websites that may let you sneak past security. That being said, Purity does a great job at putting up tough borders. The option to whitelist/blacklist terms and sites is so welcome; having an accountability partner option is also welcome; being able to report pages, block pages as you come across them, block images and videos entirely, and more, make this an incredibly useful app for protecting your heart. So I can say pretty confidently that I would recommend this app.

I also want to say to anyone reading this review that fighting temptation is an arduous process, and frequent victory over it may take a lot longer than you expected. You may find, as I have, that the issue goes deep, and you might have to cut out other things from your life beside just porn— other apps, websites, games, shows, movies, books... Things that may seem innocent enough, or innocuous, but tempt you to make the wrong choice.

In the Bible, in Matthew 5:30, Jesus says that if your right hand causes you to sin you should cut it off. He doesn’t mean literally (or Christians all across the world would be distinguishable by how maimed they are!) but he’s using a very extreme kind of imagery and language to describe the severity of action needed to overcome a sinful lifestyle. He’s saying, “If that show you like leads you to desire porn, stop watching it. Get rid of it. Rip it up from the root. If that app or game makes you lust, delete it, prevent yourself from even having access to it. Whatever tempts you, cut it out like its a cancerous mass or it will eventually kill you.”

This app will help you do that. It will help you be proactive in the fight, not just reactive. It is a handy tool in the task of uprooting bad habits in your life. And for those burdened by the guilt and shame that come with the struggle with porn, I say, “Lay that burden down at the cross of Jesus.” If we own our sin and admit our guilt, God will consistently and reliably forgive us of that sin and work in our hearts to purge those habits from our lives. (1 John 1:9) And He does that with joy, because Jesus paid the price for our guilt when he sacrificed himself in our place. God sees the finished work of Jesus— the atoning blood spilled to pay our debt and the blameless righteousness of the perfect Son— and He delights to take away your shame because you’ve been justified. To use this app is to lean into the change that God is already working in your heart, and will see to it’s end; it is to be that much more in step with living a guilt-free life.",5,{Spookydooks},2021-05-20 20:07:01-07:00,positive

Couple suggestions though - figure out a way to load captchas and buttons? Can be a bit of an issue, especially since these often occur on important sites (finance, jobs, etc). Also, rather than just cutting out pictures, replace them with a stock frame or logo or something of same dimensions.

Except you don’t have to deal with hitting the skip and X the ads always force. With other apps it just has a bit of a delay which isn’t too bad actually. However if it’s on safari, some sites will go to run an ad but just go black instead. Making you close and reopen safari to stop. Can’t refresh the page to get it to work. Can’t open in new tab to workout in. And lastly I know the VPN is working when the YouTube app on iPhone doesn’t display search history. In fact, it doesn’t even show you much suggestions when typing. It’s usually like 2-3 and then it doesn’t suggest anything anymore. However I notice now it’s showing so now I’m wondering if it’s actually working still. I know it seems to disable if I’m not on WiFi but idk. I feel like there’s a lot to talk about.

It is my best guess that the developer is playing a numbers game to make money without concern for integrity and ethical business practices. I could only stomach 4 two minute advertisements before I decided I was done with being insulted. Now, if only 1 million people out of the 300 million+ population in the US does exactly what I did (watch 4 long and lame advertisements, or 2 every time you return to the main app menu screen) and as an “example number” the developer could earn $0.05 for every add watched. That is $50K or $50,000!! 
I still gotta give credit to this “scheme” the developer has going. I’m sure so many others do this too. It is a really easy way to make a lot of money. Keep making “good idea” apps that are unusable because it really only about commercial advertising to keep revenue flowing. It’s not illegal, but it is too level lame.

However, the app could stand to have a few stories/other game content that’s purchasable via pomodoros. 
I’m only really interested in my chosen mentor so I basically accumulate pomodoros with no other means of using them. Even items like backgrounds or outfits could be purchased via pomodoro rather than money.

,1514915737,,Awesome Habits: Habit Tracker,"You can set up any number of daily, weekly or monthly habits to track, and can also put them into custom–named categories. I like that the main screen with the habits being tracked also displays a percentage of completion, which can count either your daily tasks, or all tasks via one of the settings. And the percentage of completion doesn’t seem to be an All-or-Nothing situation. For example, if a habit needs a count of seven to complete and you have only performed it four times, you get credit for that. Nice. You can activate a setting that moves completed Habits to the bottom of the daily/weekly/monthly list, so you can concentrate on the ones that aren’t completed.

Would love the following features:

1. All me to make a goal out of any Apple health metric, I don't think you need to build them all in, but rather just a section within the ""custom habit"" to pick a health stat so that it can automatically connect to that health data. 
2. An ""On or Off Track"" status indicator for the habits that are weekly or monthly as well as one for the daily status. In other words if my status is weekly, but it's tracking sugar intake, I really have no idea if I'm on track with my goal or not which forces me to to some math in my head ""ok we're halfway through the week and it looks like I'm less than halfway done so I should work on this today"" rather than seeing the gap between where I should be and where I am, or inverse, the fact that I can ignore that habit today because I'm already ahead.

Widgets very customizable. Another feature that makes this app outstanding and that other apps don’t give to much attention is the ton of icons you can choose from for your habits. You can make lists to organize your habits and see the stats by list, even have an app intertwined in other categories not only one. Another aspect that I liked about the app is that when checking the history of a habit the app is designed in a way that it doesn’t allow to accidentally modify past days, if you want to change something in the history you have to be intentional, there’s not risk of changing the history by error with the finger like in other apps. The only feature I would add is the ability to choose how many days in a week I want to track an app by quantity and not only by choosing selected weekdays like “Monday, Tuesday, etc”. I’m surprised that this app is not yet as famous as others. Ratings are great, must be only a matter of marketing. Worth every penny I paid to be a premium member, just hope that as this app grows the developers will remember my lifetime subscription because I’ve had bad experiences with apps in which I was already a lifetime member but they start charging monthly subscriptions and forget about their old offer they made with old members that were here from the beginning and apply their new terms on them too.

,1514915737,,Awesome Habits: Habit Tracker,"A lot of thought went into this app and it shows. So easy to use and a pleasant experience to mark goals complete. Tap the widget, tap the goal, and done. Or use Siri Shortcuts. This is perfect.

I was wondering if you have a roadmap anywhere on what improvements might be coming down the pipe. Some apps have an entire week view with little colored or uncolered squares showing if a goal was completed. It’s a cool way to pack a lot of data, like 10 goals over a week, and view it all at once.

Another cool feature would be multi level goals to track workouts, like the habit could be bench press, the # of reps would another dimension, and the weight would be the 3rd level dimension. Getting data in for weight and reps would mean you completed the goal of bench press, but would be cool to track weight and reps in a way that could be displayed on graphs. So not just using the notes feature for this.

Lastly, for the hardcore nerds among us, csv export of all the data in case we want to juxtapose our goals alongside data from other apps that we are tracking. Like overlaying our goals data on a graph from our smart scale app that shows our weight/ muscle mass/etc. exporting the data makes this possible and allows for the potential to make some amazing insights on how our habits can correlate to other things that we are tracking.

This app should become the solution to track everything else. We have Apple Watch and smart scales to track so many things, overlaying that data on top of anything else we want to track should make this a must have app.",5,Rocky4242,2022-09-27 10:37:16-07:00,positive

I figured out how to use Apple health with this, but it only syncs FROM Apple health, not TO it. I would prefer if it synced both ways. One other thing that I would like is if it added an option to sync “state of mind” from Apple health, and then have some sort of chart or statements about correlations between your mood and habits. That’s the only thing it’s really missing IMO. Overall I’ve really been enjoying this app. It’s really well thought out, and quite customizable. It’s motivating me to stay on track with my habits. 

The apple health habits are not working. I have habits turned on in apple health and have iCloud backup on. The problem is I add an Apple health habit, but there is no way to mark it off as completed. When I tried contacting them for help, it is asking me to download the mail app, which I do not use.

I’ve been using this app for over two years, and it’s been such a valuable tool that I’ve recommended it to my family as well. It’s genuinely helped me stay focused, and I’ve always felt it was worth paying for.

That said, I’ve noticed some recent changes that feel a bit disappointing. For example, we used to have access to strict mode for an entire day, and unlimited app blocking, which was incredibly helpful. Now, strict mode is capped at 12 hours, and the block sessions are limited to 4 hours, which feels restrictive — especially for those of us who rely on the app for long, focused periods.

I completely understand that you need to monetize — no offense at all — but I do wish the app would return to the features that originally made it feel generous and user-focused. These changes feel like a step backward in terms of flexibility.

I used to be an Android user, though, and the app I used on Android had way more flexibility with the controls and could be way stricter. 

I also loved the feature to charge $$ you for use on Android. I would like to lock down nearly everything all the time on my iphone, but I can't - strict mode has alerted me several times that I can't do that bc then my phone would be in strict mode the whole time. Well duh, that's the point. The android option allowed me to bypass, though,  any app block setting for a fee I'd set. So I'd use it in an emergency or one time use need. It was pretty slick. Money def deters me. 

Also, the location controls were better. I could set the location so precisely that the lunch room at my office was clear of the app blocks. And I could set 5 minute breaks at the top of the hour on all scheduled app blocks. Really nice if you're having a conversation on Instagram.

While it’s been helpful to keep me off my phone endlessly in the morning and at night, I created another limit to control how much time I’m allowed on an app (ex: “I want to spend 30 minutes on Instagram max.”), but it won’t allow me to put that schedule in strict mode. So it’s practically useless, since I can pause it at any time. 

 Additionally, say I was to go into one of my schedules I’ve made and add a new app. If I add it to the list of apps within the schedule, if I go to save my changes, I’m given a notification that says, “changes can’t be made, or apps would be blocked indefinitely.” So just by adding a new app— which, for premium should be unlimited addition of apps— my schedule won’t let me change anything. 
 I’m sure I could loophole it by deleting the schedule entirely and creating it again with the new app, but it shouldn’t have to be that difficult. 

 They created a “hide the pause” button, in hopes for you to be unable to keep hitting “pause for 15 minutes” for hours (guilty), but there’s nothing keeping you from simply going to setting and clicking “show pause button.” So, even in that update, it’s not helpful. 

 They asked once for feedback, and I happily gave it— not out of frustration but truly wanting to give the developer honest feedback— but there’s no space to leave your feedback in the app unless it’s asked for. So, reviews were the only way to go. 

 I would love to see this app succeed, but I’m struggling to stay without any updates.",3,sarahb1111.,2024-06-06 08:03:21-07:00,negative

I was also chill enough to buy one of the workbooks for $29 upon downloading the app in hopes of using it and I didn’t use either. After I asked for the $59.99 refund I mentioned that I didn’t use the app and I payed for $29 for the unused workbook and asked if I could at at least get a partial refund and nothing.

,1518956326,,MyRoutine: Routine Habit Goal,"Life changing! I originally downloaded this app to build habits. Checking each habit I’ve completed feels so satisfying. It’s that small sense of pride that keeps you going. No matter how small that change seems, when you incorporate into your everyday life, it makes a difference. This app gives me an excuse to not skip out on small tasks from flossing to getting ahead of my assignments. The functions could be a bit smoother and the emoji keyboard has a small scrolling back-and-forth bug, but this app still does its job and completes its purpose well. The thing I love most about this app is how you can build a series of routines and have a timer for each of them. If you take too long, then the timer will turn red and begin to count your overtime. That has shown me when I surprisingly take too long on something that I didn’t think was a problem. Best of all, you have the option to make habits repeat between certain weekdays or a number of times a week, and if you do finish something that was a goal, you can mark it off forever. For example, when I got my braces off today, I could mark my habit of wearing elastics as forever completed. :) Something this app could change is seeing progress as “last 7 days” or “last 30 days” instead of “this week” or “this month”. Because when you just started a month, there’s not much to see with “this month,” and that forces me to scroll back to see my progress from last month, which is less efficient.",5,Iconic_Bond,2025-02-09 17:01:19-07:00,positive

Secondly— the LOOK! I’m a spreadsheet girl, plain and simple as that. The customization is always fun too. And finally— the routines themselves! I love that I can easily make weekly and daily habits and toggle between having them on specific days or just up to a certain # of times in a given time range.

,1523968394,,Focused Work - Pomodoro Timer,"This app checks several of the boxes I’m looking for in a pomodoro system. Though, I can’t bring myself to use this app or pay for the subscription as it’s incredibly ugly. It needs a substantial UI upgrade. Very off-putting colors, constrained menus, odd layouts, etc. The entire experience needs to be more minimal while maintaining functionality. What’s worse, is there isn’t a single setting to alter any part of the app’s appearance, which is a very odd decision on the developers part. 

For instance, the green and orange glowing icons on the session structure screen. Yikes. That along with the ugly, bold purple core app color is just terrible. I also don’t understand why integrations is mentioned on this screen, it’s already in settings. There’s also a glitchy Siri thing at the bottom that is spazzing out. It’s unfortunate because having a session view screen like this that breaks down and labels each section of the pomodoro system isn’t available in other apps that I’m aware of. And it’s a bit ruined by the ugliness of it all. 

Also the tiny icons above the pomodoro timer wrapped in a bold red line. Why?? This is so weird. The entire top of the app is so cluttered and strange. And the bold red, uneditable color of the timer is not cool. And again, why is integrations on a tiny system menu icon that’s just cluttering up the limited space available? Integrations should be in settings and left alone. Makes absolutely no sense to keep pushing integrations. If someone wanted to use the functionality, they will… in settings. 

You also can’t remove the dumb tomato icon in front of pomodoro. Some of your users are over 12 and don’t want to use emojis. Weird thing to hardcode.

Under appearance settings, where you’re weirdly only able to edit the font thickness (seriously), it even shows a purple timer color and yet the only available color on the actual main screen is VERY red. 

We also don’t need the “ready to focus?” text. Yes, we’re ready to focus, that’s why we downloaded a focus app. 

This isn’t to say that other pomodoro apps are much better, though some apps with limited functionality have a much better UI.

This app has a lot going for it, but as a person who shys away from ugly apps, I just can’t bring myself to use it. But I do see a lot of potential here, so I’ll check back to see if UI improvements are made.",3,hfksiejendiejwnsn,2024-11-03 11:20:57-07:00,negative

Add to that the ability to integrate Shortcuts and it becomes a powerful tool with a lot of flexibility and potential. 

However, although it boasts many strengths, it does still have one (admittedly, superficial/minor) flaw: The emojis are non-negotiable. For all its flexibility, not having the option to opt out of using emojis—especially when they’re displayed so prominently—is incredibly distracting, and incentivizes me to hide what is otherwise a clean interface with crisp Live Activities.

I love that Focused Work offers a Flowmodoro option, a flexible timer, and the traditional Pomodoro. The Toggl integration is also very convenient. This app has really boosted my productivity.

I knocked off one star because there are some features that I find extremely annoying. So much so that every now and then, I stop using the app, try to find something similar, but never find it, so I come back. The main issue is the notifications. I didn’t like them, so I turned them off. Now I get reminders to turn on notifications so that I can get reminders! It really makes no sense. Then there are the reminders to rate and review, which I guess worked.

You be assaulted by an endless stream of quizzes, that are very hard to focus through, and added, time consuming pointless graphics splash screens and glossy nothingness. Users are completely captive to this endless process, and it is extremely stressful for my adhd.  I devoted close to an hour trying to get into this app and became so frustrated I submitted a support request and detailed, fair and respectful feedback for them to approve. 

They didn’t reply to my message content, then they charged me $200, one week after downloading for a trial, and trying my best to communicate with the developers about my situation and asking for help. 

Stay away from this app. It was developed by developers, for developers, without an understanding of what adhd users will actually think and feel. This app will profit off us, inappropriately, because adhders are particularly susceptible to bait and switch predatory pricing tactics.

However, these ideas are introduced and dropped. It would be great to have more guided opportunities to engage with them so they stick better.

    UPDATE: So the Adblock “works” but on YouTube you have to keep refreshing the page in order for it to work after you tap on each video (I use it on my iPad & my phone) it’s a bit annoying, but at least they found a workaround for now, before it wasn’t blocking them ads AT ALL.

,1540472983,,Betwixt–The Mental Health Game,"Now, I’m not saying this app is a replacement for therapy. But what I am saying is that the raw experiences I’ve had in this app were better and more psychologically productive than any therapy session I’ve been to in the past. This is just what I needed for how my brain works and its analytical and emotional side. I learned great things about myself, life, memories, self esteem, trauma, etc. Not to mention, this app is accessible. I couldn’t pay for it but really wished to continue the stories sense they were helping me, and so I signed up for a free account sponsored by someone else. I cannot fully express my tremendous gratitude for that feature. I have tremendous gratitude for this entire project, as I haven’t found anything else like it. I hope in the future there will be more, but for now I can take the lessons I’ve learned and am one step closer to living my life to the fullest.

,1540472983,,Betwixt–The Mental Health Game,"I have only just started with the app, and it is lovely so far, but felt the need to comment now as this issue is really bothering me up front and keeping me from spending the time in the app that I need to.

I wish the developers would increase the font size a bit more, and consider making the font colors a bit darker when on a light background (or vice a versa … I haven’t gotten far enough in to know if there is later dark backgrounds with dark text), so that there is more contrast. 

It is a strain at the current size and light font color, which adds to headaches and stress, which is counterproductive to what the app is trying to do. I need to use the app right now, to try to reduce the bad headaches and tension I am feeling at this moment, and some of the anxiety and PTSD issues, but I cannot because of the eye strain. Just trying to read the text is adding to the headaches and tension, which is in itself causing anxiety. 

Or maybe the developers could build in some options for the user to set the font size and color, or tweak the contrast? 

There is no reason, with this being a text based experience, that the font size can’t be made more readable. I can’t be the only one who would like it to be easier on the eyes. I would up my rating to 5 stars if they did this! Please, please, please!!!",3,SummerHaunt,2024-05-11 12:48:53-07:00,negative

I am beyond excited to continue this journey of self discovery in way that is completely captivating, immersive, and refreshingly authentic.

,1540472983,,Betwixt–The Mental Health Game,"Real person, I promise, and if you read some of my other reviews I can be highly critical and sound like a Karen quite honestly. I wasn’t even looking for an app like this mental health wise or gaming wise. The types of videos I watch about having better mental health just kinda popped the ad for this app onto my screen.

I’ve always enjoyed guided meditation along with choose your own adventure games. This app is the best of both worlds! It has peaceful music with therapeutic storyline and prompts or times where you can respond with your own entry. The “narrator” doesn’t speak so the voice that your mind comes up with to read their lines in is all up to your interpretation.

Now, I did get bummed at first upon realizing that there is a tiered payment system after the first 3 levels, however, do not let this run you away! It is only a one time payment! This is in order to help the company grow and it is not at all a money grab like most of the other apps out there! There are 3 different payments you can choose from to continue your journey and all of them are only a one time payment that unlocks everything at that tier permanently, the lowest of which I believe was $13.99 if I remember correctly. So they really do try to make it as affordable as possible. This is just a very small company that needs help in order to grow, so every penny helps.

There is such a creative and kind team behind the Betwixt App. As a player, you can tell that a lot of time and effort went into putting the resources together and creating the story mode adventure. Really great app and just what I never knew I needed!",5,.Cat.S.,2025-01-08 23:29:58-07:00,positive

Also. Thank you thank you thank you for making the free version. I can’t tell you how immeasurably valuable it has been to be able to access so much and be able to continue through the progress I feel I’m making without worrying about the trial period ending.

,1541027222,,ScreenZen- Screen Time Control,"I’ve tried my fair share of screen time apps, and most of them left me frustrated—either because of expensive subscriptions or because they weren’t effective enough. ScreenZen, however, has completely changed my perspective.

What makes it stand out to me is the thoughtful design. Instead of simply blocking apps, it gives you a customizable pop-up that asks if you really want to use one of your daily “passes.” That pause, that question, makes me think twice—and it works. On top of that, the app has a strict cut-off option for when I need firmer boundaries, which I appreciate.

But what impressed me most is their approach to cost. ScreenZen doesn’t demand a subscription. It’s available freely, with the option to support the developers through donations. For people like me who can’t afford to subscribe to dozens of apps (because of medical expenses, in my case), this is an absolute gift. And despite being donation-based, the service is excellent—better than many paid alternatives I’ve tried.

I still use my phone and apps, I just do it more intentionally now. For example, I only allow myself to open YouTube 5x per day, for 7 min each time.

,1544743900,,Hush Nag Blocker,"### How Hush Works Hush is a content blocker for Safari that focuses on blocking nag screens, such as cookie consent banners and privacy-intrusive tracking scripts. It does this by using a set of rules that target specific scripts and elements on web pages without interacting directly with the site itself. ### Why It Might Be Less Effective Now 1. **Lack of Updates**: The Hush app and its GitHub project have not seen significant updates recently, which might mean it's not keeping up with new tracking techniques and ad implementations. 2. **Advanced Obfuscation**: Some websites employ advanced methods to bypass blockers, which Hush may not be updated to counter. 3. **Evolving Web Standards**: The web is constantly evolving, and without regular updates, any blocker may fall behind in its effectiveness. Checkout the developers GitHub page (found on the website) to see that it’s been inactive 4 years. Thank you Hush for the great service you provided, and I hope to see you again.

I’ve used this for about two months now and the sites that I’ve reported as slipping through the cracks (a bunch) have yet to be blocked. And in those cases, this app actually prevents me from proceeding past the consent pop up. As for the description, it’s not really clear what this app is doing. there’s no documentation or much of any explanation of what’s going on behind-the-scenes. The only real source of anything is a GitHub link. and once you navigate around and find the developers biographical page or about me section, one of the first things I noticed was that he says he doesn’t have time to invest in his projects. So…. This isn’t a money-making tool. I get that. It would be nice to know upfront more about the app I’m downloading, how it works, how often it is or isn’t updated, etc. After looking around on the repository, I see that it is working very much the same way as Easylist and incorporates the fanboy list.

It really needs to have support on other devices though.

,1551848949,,Migiri: Porn Blocker & More,"Just a heads up for future readers and potential users, $145 /year. No other payment plan options. That does NOT include therapist sessions which is an extra $60 /session. Free trial lasts a week. 

The blocker works well in browsers, but not integrated well enough to use in apps, contrary to what the app’s description states. Yes, you can block the website that the app pulls its data from, but that in turns blocks the entire app, regardless of the url you enter. A good example is Reddit. Reddit has lots of content, that includes porn; however, blocking Reddit.com, or even blocking specific NSFW communities, blocks the entire app. Not helpful. I still want to browse Reddit, but just with NSFW content blocked, and Migiri is not capable of this. 

The price tag was enough to turn me away. I think I speak for most when I say porn is watched due to depression, and depressed people don’t have $200+ to throw away on an app.",2,Chris22599,2023-09-05 11:07:25-07:00,negative
,1551848949,,Migiri: Porn Blocker & More,"I'm still within my free trial of Migiri and seriously contemplating subscribing and buying the annual membership.

I first got Migiri and I was a little skeptical. I had tried other blockers and things, but the fact that Migiri focused or seemed to want to focus on MORE than just blocking, drew me to it.

Before I get on to talking about why I love the app, I will say that I wasn't pleased about not getting notifications from the app or my chosen companion getting emails to celebrate / cheer me on. 

I emailed the Migiri team about the issue and they responded quickly and a few days later, the issue was resolved. It means a lot to be that I, as a user, was treated respectfully, in a timely manner, and heard.

Now, going back to what i've enjoyed from Migiri... I loved that there were some lessons to help me contemplate my addiction and behaviors. I love that one of the lessons helped focus on accepting a relapse and doubling down on the commitment to quit.

I can't say for anyone else, but that lesson really helped me get to understand who I am, what I need, and why I relapse.

So yes, I would suggest this app to anyone who's trying to quit porn. A blocker isn't good enough because there is always a way to circumvent it if you look hard and long.

However, a blocker that also helps you change and grow so that you can some day not need a blocker so well worth the price.

As for all of y'all on this journey, you got this and keep at it. You're not alone and you do matter. I would suggest y'all get this app and also try groups, therapy, blockers, church, and friends.

I do want to ask if there is a possibility of having a break time as soon as the Focus Timer is complete? I think it would make it more affective! I notice as soon as my timer is complete, I get distracted and forget to restart another timer. Keeping the Focus Timer and Rest Time when exiting the app is great, but having a Rest Time then going back into another Focus Session would be even better!!   

And, to have the option of shuffling or picking a specific song out of the given playlists on the Focus Music, I like picking where my playlist will start! Not sure if this is out of your capabilities since it involves another app that is outside FocusTraveller. Yes, I could do it separately in another tab, but it would be so convenient!!

If read, I appreciate you taking time to view this. I hope my thoughts are taken into consideration. Thank you much!

,1559730367,,Focus Traveller - Flow Timer,"I recently switched to FocusTraveller from the Flora app, which I had used for years. It had become virtually unusable because of its glitches. 

I love the intuitive interface of the app, and the graphics are gorgeous. The prompt to take deep breaths are helpful. I love the ability to take breaks and choose your traveler. 

It would be great to see a few valuable features I enjoyed from other productivity apps. 

1. Adding a sense of progression to keep it engaging. In other apps, I liked how spending more time on the app allowed you to unlock new features, like growing new plant species or exploring new areas. It made the experience more rewarding and less monotonous. Introducing a similar gamification element here would be a fantastic addition and help keep users motivated- maybe adding different maps to explore or customization for your traveler (like clothes/accessories or a pet that travels with you). 

1.5: Special badges- the Flora app not only allowed users to unlock new plant species to grow as they spent more time focusing; they also gifted a badge for every plant that was grown either with a friend or through a paid session (putting money on the line). Seeing those badges was very rewarding, so even when I ran out of plants to unlock, I focused on earning both badges for every plant I had. Visual reinforcement for progression is KEY to keeping users interested in coming back to the app. 

2. Allowing users to put money on the line. Flora allowed users to choose a value (between $5-$100) to be charged if they took a break or left the app. This is useful for those who need an extra push to stay focused on their task- it helped me a LOT during finals season.

3. The ability to block distracting apps during the focus session. This adds an extra barrier to simply scrolling on social media while the session is running. I benefitted a LOT from this feature, as I sometimes open distracting apps without even thinking when I get bored. 

4. The ability to add friends without Game Center. I very, very frequently studied with friends through the Flora app. It provides an extra layer of accountability. Providing a QR code or a username to add friends through would be convenient. 

I have diagnosed ADHD, but these features kept me coming back to the Flora app for a little less than four years. I really love FocusTraveller and would love to see the aforementioned updates. I think they would enhance the experience and keep distracted users engaged and coming back for more. 

I hope these suggestions were helpful. Thanks for reading my review!",4,SocialLonerFromFrance,2024-08-28 09:46:33-07:00,positive

The combination of the calming music and seeing my character climbing a mountain really helps me actually focus. I’ve downloaded similar apps in the past, but they were too passive and were literally just timers to keep you off your phone. My brain will get always get itchy and I’ll go back to my phone. I’ve tried listening to just music, podcasts, having YouTube videos on in the background, just having silence, listening to white noise, NOTHING has stopped my brain from getting itchy and then going right back to my phone and losing focus and valuable work time. There’s something about watching the movement of my character that gives me a little focus boost. I have no idea why this app works as well as it does, but it does!!!! If you have problems focusing, give this a download. There’s a free version you can try to get a feel for it and if you want to get the premium version it’s a one time payment of $7.99 and you can use the premium features of the app for life!

I’ll definitely be using this going forward to focus on language learning or other tasks as I felt it was super helpful!
I love that there is a one-time purchase option for the subscription as I love being able to pay outright if I want to use something! I actually ended up picking up the full version because I felt it helped me enough and I want to support the dev to keep supporting this app with new features! As a game dev myself I feel it’s very important to support the things you love!

Some features I’d love to see added: a Lock Screen widget, an Apple Watch app (please I would love to use this on my watch so I don’t have to always have my phone with me! It would increase my use of this 100x so I didn’t have to use my phone battery all of the time!), have a tab to change the pie chart to a bar graph (or just add it below) I love the pie chart, but something about a bar graph with each of my sections listed and colored is just nice), finally I’d love to be able to add goals (like I want to spend X time on this each week) and then the traveller could mark it off on their journal when completed during the end of focus session log

Happy to pay for it

If I could ask for only one small change, is the fact that the counting report consider every mark on the calendar.
For example:
I went to the gym 5 times this week, so I will put the checkmark 5 times ✅
But I will also put 2 times the x ❌
For those days that I didn’t work.

The problem is that when I see the report, it shows 7 counts. Instead of 5 yes and 2 no’s

So would be fantastic to have a filter according to your emoji

Из бесплатного контента очень нравятся медитации из раздела «экстренная помощь» - когда нужно проработать тревогу, страх, печаль. Такие 5-минутки очень эффективны, а голос актеров позволяет полностью сконцентрироваться на смысле. Нравится содержание уведомлений и то, что можно управлять их регулярностью. 
Абсолютно раздражает то, что ежедневно приходят уведомления с текстом «медитация: такая-то, доступно только сегодня». Я захожу в приложение и в итоге мне по-прежнему недоступна эта медитация. Во-первых, чувствуешь себя обманутым, а во-вторых, это тоже мое время: я обращаю внимание на приложение и захожу проверить, действительно ли сегодня открылось что-то новое. Каждый раз разочарование. 
Также я недовольна тем, что нет полного бесплатного курса. Было бы классно, если бы уроки курса по запросу (самооценка, спокойствие, сон и тд) открывались ежедневно, чтобы сформировалась какая-то привычка слушать медитации не только вообще, но и в вашем приложении.

The app lets you create typographical lists of app shortcuts on your home screen. However, adding apps is a hassle because the search results often show irrelevant apps or give ""No results found"" if you scroll too fast. 

Another drawback is that once you create a widget, you can't edit it; you have to start over if you want to make changes. Additionally, some apps aren’t currently supported so the workaround is for the Blank Spaces app to create a shortcut in your shortcuts library. But this shortcut is their to launch another shortcut already in your library. So when you finally have it setup and tap one of these shortcuts on your home screen, you’re taken to your Shortcuts library where it launches that actual shortcut.  

These issues may be shortcomings of iOS itself. I don’t know.

,1572515807,,ClearSpace: Reduce Screen Time,"Ive had clearspace a long time, and the change was not immediate. I have a 189 day streak right now and i only noticed a change like two weeks ago. Before clearspace i was spending up to 10 hours a day on my phone and up to 30-35 hours a week on instagram alone. Now, I spend 5 or less on instagram per week and 40 or less minutes per day. The screen time is the smaller part of why I like this app though; what I really like is the pushup challenge. I used to do cross country but quit a long time ago, and when i started doing the pushup challenge, it was the first time in about two years i saw an improvement in my body and not a steady decline in my physical condition. I did 1 pushup per 3 minutes for a 31 day challenge, and at the end i noticed it was much easier to do pushups, so I started a 100 day challenge with 1 pushup per 1 minute. I’m a week and a half in and I suddenly realized that over the last month my body has gotten visibly more strong, especially my chest. I can also see my abs more clearly. This little improvement and the fact that I was doing around 50 pushups to 70 pushups a day inspired me, and I finally started working out for the sake of working out again. I lift weights, do pushups, and do core sometimes. It’s not something I spend a huge amount of time on, but im seeing a gradual improvement in my physical condition and willingness to improve my habits. I highly recommend downloading this app.

P.S.
There are a few things wrong with the app; i wish i could put limits on more than one app for free, i uninstalled youtube to keep myself off shorts as an alternative to reels; however, this isnt a huge problem cause there isnt much to do on my phone anyway. 
I also notice that the app has a very hard time realizing if im doing pushups unless im looking straight at the camera and going slow; this hasnt bothered me too much, but sometimes I’ll do like twenty pushups for ten minutes. Usually it works a lil better when im in short sleeves or when i turn on a bunch of lights.

,1572515807,,ClearSpace: Reduce Screen Time,"I really like Clearspace and the features offered in the Pro version, and I appreciate the effort behind the app. However, the inability to apply restrictions to an entire category of apps (like all games) at once is a significant drawback. Having to select and restrict each app individually creates a lot of friction and takes much more time than it should.
This tedious process is actually enough to dissuade me from continuing to use the app, despite its other benefits. Managing multiple apps one by one feels outdated and inefficient, especially when many other apps offer bulk management features.
I understand there may be technical limitations due to Apple’s ScreenTime API, but I strongly urge the Clearspace team to explore solutions for bulk category restrictions or at least a more streamlined multi-app selection process. This improvement would make a huge difference in usability and user retention.

Regardless, I’m going to pay for ClearSpace once the free trial is over. There are small details that make this app more effective (for me, at least) than others like it. For example, ClearSpace you pick how long you want to use the app at a time (from 1-10 minutes) right as you open the app. Then, when time runs out, it says, “the time you set aside for this app is over.” Theoretically I could unlock the app again but I never do…because the app is reminding me that I picked that shorter time (I usually pick 5 minutes, never 10), so I feel compelled to stick to it!

According to a review I read, Eyezy had a better system. Come to find out, there was no free trial available. Since my child has their phone already and I was starting to get desperate to find a monitoring software, I decided to take the risk and buy a year of it. Now I feel completely cheated because, while the app is available for iPhone, when you actually buy the service and set it up, and go to the activity monitoring, it comes up with a page that says, “This feature will only work if your child’s phone is an Android.” This should have been CLEARLY AND UNMISTAKABLY communicated before I spent $100 on an app. On top of that, the app is rife with grammatical errors.

,1576857102,,Workout Tracker Gentler Streak,"The ""Gentler Streak"" fitness app encourages a self-compassionate approach to exercise and provides a balance between fitness and rest. It offers personalized suggestions for daily workout actions, which can range from rest to intense workouts. It helps me - a 67 year old guy who values a balanced approach to fitness and well-being - stay within healthy activity levels. 

With an intuitive UI, it’s so easy to use, even my grandma could do it—and she can’t tell a smartwatch from her headstone. It’s easy to understand and won’t leave you sweating the small stuff.

The app’s feedback is so encouraging, it’s like having a cheerleader in your pocket. It’ll lift your spirits higher than a kettlebell! 
Additionally, the app provides relevant, actionable insights and expert knowledge in short reads.

Edit 2: I didn’t open it for a couple weeks and the widget said for all of that time that I was either well rested or overreaching. It never said I was on the right track and it took days to go from overreaching to the well rested, never stopping in the middle.

,1593891243,,(Not Boring) Habits,"Habits is one of the best habit trackers I’ve ever used. It’s beautiful, fun, encouraging, and the satisfaction of getting another level makes it so I don’t need 50 notifications a day to open it (and it doesn’t send you a ton like other apps.)

The big problem is it’s subscription. It’s $70/year if you want any decent “skins”, the cheaper tier doesn’t include any fun ones. That’s way too much for a habits app.

Theoretically it includes 3 other apps, but this is the only good one. The other apps included are extremely over-designed and underpowered, an example of when you have designers over following trends who’ve never used the app they’re building. The calculator app is great until it lags while you type a 3 digit number, the weather app doesn’t look as good or act as well as the stock weather app that’s free or something like Carrot weather which is cheaper. The timer app has no live activity support, doesn’t support hours, and is just all around unusable. Out of all the apps, this one feels like the devs never opened a timer before in their life.

,1603024803,,Ochi: Block Websites & Apps,"I have been looking for a blocker for both apps and websites while I am at work. After quite some research, I settled on Ochi, which is really easy to set up and works on both macOS and iOS. Ochi has all the modern perks of a native Apple app, supporting Shortcuts and iCloud syncing among other things. The developer is very responsive to support questions. The free version is beyond generous, offering a single filter that can be configured to block an unlimited number of apps and websites together. 

The only major limitation on macOS so far is that website blocking does not work on Firefox (for which I use LeechBlock, an open-source extension). Web blocking works very well on Safari and Chrome-based browsers. On iOS there are more system limitations, but Ochi has managed to accomplish a lot within these limits. It is particularly clever to use the Focus mode for macOS control of Ochi filters across Apple devices.",5,chchen2021,2022-05-25 18:36:34-07:00,positive

In my experience so far on an M1 Mac, the app has been pretty much unusable, with lots of beach wheels and complete unresponsiveness. Even worse, when I tried to set up a filter with specific apps blocked, it ended up blocking apps I had NOT selected, ones that were CRUCIAL to my workflow.

Lately on iOS I’ve been able to bypass the filter by simply clicking “reopen site”, which normally would refresh the page but still ultimately lock me out of the site.

Another element that I have not used much but has helped in one instance is the breathing tool. Two negatives of the app is that it is not as easy to navigate and the in app purchases to get support and the financial penalty of it if you relapse does not seem like a great strategy to support someone struggling with consistency.,4,Hhbdazc,2025-05-15 07:09:07-07:00,neutral

,1613169688,,Parental Controls by Ohana,"I am 15 and my mom used this app for me instead of the built in screen time. It was personally embarrassing for any of my peers to see that not only did I have screen time as a high schooler but I had an app called Ohana. The app made it so my mom could see everything on my phone, and would look at everything on it which made me feel like I had no privacy in anything. Because not only could she track me but she could control and see everything on it. She would constantly question me on websites I was on which led to many misunderstandings and fights that could have been avoided. This also made me feel like I had no control over anything which crushed my self esteem, and would make me feel constantly angry with her and her need to control my life. It’s stupid to center your life around a phone, but to my generation we need a little freedom and a phone is a big step of freedom and having that taken away feels terrible.
So not only did this app lead to many fights that could have been avoided it made me have a sense of no freedom and caused me to get made fun of by my friends. If you get this app please don’t use it as my parents have.",1,Liam7373,2025-04-24 22:25:44-07:00,negative

For example, when you delete or modify the time duration of a step within a routine, the overall duration for said routine does not always adjust for the changes made. 

Like some other reviewers stated, the alarm that sounds when the time has ended for a step needs to be louder. Another suggestion is that an alarm sounds when there is a minute left for completion of the step rather than 30 seconds.

That’s on me. But to my surprise, when I woke up this morning, I was billed $100 for the family pro plan. Really? The absolutely highest tier of billing. Not the $3.99 for the monthly plan or even the $24.99 for the annual. I guess that was in the fine print, but seems like a skeezy way to get top dollar for subscriptions. Seriously, how much is this product even worth? There’s one subscription plan that is $24.99 PER MONTH after free trial. Also the mid tier annual and the pro are both $24.99 PER YEAR. With this much variation I plan to reach out to the developer to see if they will change my plan and give me a refund.

,1644737181,,BePresent: Screen Time Control,"Yesterday it tracked over 50 hours of screen time and I downloaded the app in the afternoon. It’s my first morning at 8:45 AM and I already have 21 hours of screen time. The only app I was running was Hulu cuz I run shows while I sleep, and the settings show the tracking should be turned off for that app. It says I was in my banking app (which is not and was not open) for 7.5 hours and that I played a game for three hours that I only played for about fifteen minutes before I fell asleep last night. 

I like the app but it’s kind of a lot of money for it to be this insanely inaccurate. The help article about it says it’s Apple’s fault lol.

On top of this there’s no way to exclude single apps from screen time, just categories of apps. This isn’t a problem though because the tracking is so ridiculously bad that it doesn’t matter if it’s tracking the time or not.

The blocking features are pretty good though and it might be worth paying for it just for that, but it’s a YEAR subscription, no way to pay monthly… right now with the tracking so bad I’m having concerns committing to a whole year…",2,djcneodncj,2025-07-29 08:50:53-07:00,negative
,1644737181,,BePresent: Screen Time Control,The app itself is amazing but they need allow excluding individual apps immediately.

,1644737181,,BePresent: Screen Time Control,"I have a very strong mindfulness meditation practice, but I still find myself occasionally scrolling for too long on Instagram and using my phone as a distraction. This app seemed like a wonderful idea and I love the name and concept, so I thought I'd give it a try. Like some others have stated, it offers you a free trial followed by a year long subscription, and if you don't accept that it will offer you 60% off. The catch is if you take the discount, you don't get a free trial and they charge you right away. And I very quickly realized that the app doesn't work for me. It has too many features and things I don't need and I actually find it a little bit overwhelming and excessive. That said, I do think it could be helpful for a lot of people. I find that downtime is a suitable option for me and basically just a simplified version of what this app is. But if you like having a streak and a bunch of different options to connect with people, track progress, receive gifts and reminders, and if phrases like ""please I'm begging you open instagram"" deters you from opening it, you might love this app. I'd personally rather work on my mindfulness practice and addiction to distraction as a whole which also helps lower screen time. Apple denied my two requests for a refund, they deny 95% of my requests which is very frustrating because they are all authentic and valid requests, but I reached out to the company and they were very friendly and did offer me a one time refund after I explained what happened. And I appreciate that they responded and offered this refund which most companies don't. I don't think it's a scam, but I did tell them that I felt like I was sort of tricked into buying a subscription and for an app that is meant to improve your well-being, to push so hard for someone to make a purchase just doesn't feel very aligned with their purpose. However, I do understand that everyone needs to make a living and if this app does help people use their phone less then that is wonderful.",3,ninacavini,2025-10-04 09:01:20-07:00,neutral

1. It would be beneficial to incorporate the ability to run multiple timers simultaneously.

2. Presently, when I set a timer for 30 minutes, it occupies half of the displayed circle, while a 60-minute timer fills the entire circle. I recommend adding a feature that allows the circle to represent the full visual space, regardless of the timer duration. For instance, if I set a timer for 15 minutes, it should visually occupy the same amount of space as a 60-minute timer does currently.

When I saw one for ADHDers I was really hopeful. So I signed up.

I am super disappointed with the notifications daily that ask me about Dentist (I have anxiety around the dentist) or Date Night (which I have little time or money to afford), that ask me about memory lapses and forgetting things and start with “Crikey” as if to tell me oh no you messed up again, and remind me about having intense emotions.

None of these notifications help me feel positive about things I need to do. I end up feeling angry and criticized every time I get a reminder of how forgetful I am and unpleasant feeling I have. And of course, being an ADHDer, I forgot to cancel before my free week was up.

I’m really regretting paying so much for a year of this. I now will have to cancel my Fabulous app, which I did enjoy, because I can only afford one.

I’m continuing to use the app and tag but have noticed several bugs or defects while I’ve used it. On occasions when I have temporarily disabled a couple of my schedules but not all of them, the schedules that I have disabled continue to run, restricting access to my apps. For example, I have a schedule that restricts apps from 8 AM - 5PM, M-F and another that blocks shopping apps 24/7 while I was on an no-spending challenge. I disabled the 8-5/M-F schedule because I was on vacation but wanted to keep the shopping apps blocked and the app continued to block my other apps that were in the 8-5/M-F schedule. I ended up having to also disable my shopping 24/7 schedule to get access to the apps in my 8-5/M-F schedule. 

Today at 7:15 AM, I needed to disable my 8-5/M-F just for today so clicked on the prompt “Disable for Today” when I was asked and all of the apps listed in that schedule became blocked. First off, I just disabled it and second off, it wasn’t even 8 AM so even if it wasn’t disabled they shouldn’t have been blocked.

These inconsistencies, bugs/defects are annoying and frustrating especially because I have the tag and can’t just unblock my apps without either scanning it (which is annoying because I but the tag in the garage on a high shelf to add friction) or use emergency mode. I’d like to eventually shut off emergency mode so I can’t use that loophole but can’t do that with the issues that I’m having.

Again, love the idea and if you don’t have to make changes to your set schedules then it’s awesome. I’ve found that I’m more present and focused at work and during time with my family but those glitches are pretty annoying.

,1673743726,,Unpluq: Reduce Screen Time,"This is one of the only blocking apps that allows you to scan a QR code to unlock. I have one stuck to the fridge so that if I want to use a distracting app I have to go physically to the fridge, which works quite well. Unfortunately, it doesn’t allow you to lock it to a specific QR code, so I can bypass it by scanning any random QR code, eg I can scan any pass/ticket in Wallet on my watch. Since I wear my watch to bed this somewhat negates the barrier to midnight doomscrolling of having to trek downstairs to the kitchen. I’m mostly successful with pretending I didn’t discover that, but it does require a bit more willpower.

(To the devs: the alarm clock app Alarmy allows you to lock it to a specific QR code, if you want inspiration! It seems to work by just storing the text it read from the code. This allows me to generate different codes and specify for example that I have to go to my exercise bike to shut the alarm up some mornings, and just the kitchen other mornings. Similarly it might be useful to be able to block some apps with a QR code I put on a keyring and other apps with a QR code that stays at home for example.)

I figure it’s possibly intentional if they’re trying to funnel me towards buying the actual unpluq device, but I’m happy enough paying monthly, I shouldn’t have to also buy a fairly pointless object to make the app work better.

If they ever implement specific QR codes I’ll increase to 5 stars.

Would like to see unlimited app’s blocking like the android app. Maybe that will be added sometime in the future. The tap tag comes in a nice gift box with a little instruction card insert. It is shipped in a protective mailer to keep it in good condition during shipping.,5,1987JF,2023-12-15 23:00:39-07:00,positive

I keep the tag in a jar on a shelf, and having ti walk over and get it prevents probably 99% of my idle scrolling. It’s been a huge time saver and also helps me feel less distracted in general. I had tried apps that set timers but they weren’t flexible enough, so had been looking for a solution exactly like this. It really works!

One feature is wish for is the ability to customize unblocking to only accept specific QR codes. For example, creating a QR code for ""wake up"" would be assigned to my morning schedule. That way I'd have to scan the ""wake up"" QR code at my kitchen table to successfully unblock my morning schedule. This would be a force multiplier on the effectiveness of the blocking and aid in new habit formation

When clicking unblock, after scanning the physical tag, the app often freezes on me. I then have to hard quit and restart the app. Then, often times the apps are not actually unblocked. On a number of occasions the apps have not been blocked when they were supposed to be and I’ve had to hard restart my phone. Small things, but this is the only thing the app is supposed to do and when you get consistent emails about investing, it’s hard to square the lack of the basic functionality it’s supposed to provide.

I understand what sets you apart from Apple Screen Time is that there is a physical dongle, but the price of the subscription makes it feel like I’m renting said dongle at an exorbitant price.

a few convenience issues that honestly don’t interfere with my use of the app, though

buggy UI: when I’m trying to do work on my website/app block list, it keeps glitching out and not letting me edit or change things. the display will hide or become unresponsive

flexibility issues: I would like to be able to set amounts of time I can spend on things as well as chunk out periods where i can’t access them at all. 

occasionally just doesn't work: sometimes my stuff just straight up isn’t blocked, which is confusing.

website problems: i use facebook messenger to connect with friends and family, but i have a problem with accessing mobile facebook through safari. you cannot block one without blocking the other, however. this likely isn’t something the developers can change unless they were to do specific work with facebooks API or whatever. IDK i don’t code.

They do not currently have protection for iOS (the child app has been removed for a while from the Apple store) and any child can easily turn off the chromebook app (literally with a mouse click) which were the two os's I bought this for - which they still even say they protect on their website and the Apple and Google stores!

I had to discover that they don't work on either type of device after finding out that my son was able to get into everything and had turned the software off. There wasn't even a warning from the software app that something was turned off. 

They don't tell you this and blame both Google and Apple for the issue. At best, they are misleading. At worst, it's a deceptive business practice or fraud.

Apparently Apple believes that the company/Employee relationship is morn Porten and then the parent/child responsibility. Apple does not care that parents want to protect their children from the filth and vile that is on the Internet. Apple does not want to lose the enterprise business that would result if they restricted companies from using mobile device management. Instead they cowardly attack parents by restricting the most protective apps. Parents are simply trying to protect their children from the most harmful exposures.

,314498713,,BetterSleep: Relax and Sleep,"BetterSleep was my primary sleep app from 2014 to 2025: unfortunately, the app has changed to try to capitalize on other sleep app markets in ways that have made the app hard to use.

As a soundscape app, the ratio of free-to-upcharged noise options has drifted with updates over the years. The most recent app update reduced access to sounds to the single digits: insult to injury, mixes that are user made and have been in use for years are still stored but inaccessible. Someone new to the app wouldn't be able to build mixes they like and get to know the value of the sound library, and the change leaves a sour taste for a long time free user familiar with the library.

There's been a rapid pivot to serve as a sleep hygiene management app, but it unfortunately also doesn't have features that are competitive. BetterSleep does not offer wide ranging integration with sleep tracker devices, which would be the biggest draw that could tip the scales towards investing in a membership on top of my fitness tracker app's membership.

I went ahead and bought the full app (that’s right, bought, not rented, not subscribed, bought, for a one time price) as well as talked my wife into trying one of their sleep/clock apps. Everything was great. Over time after meditating around the same time every day, my anxiety almost disappeared. I eventually did most of the meditations multiple times and with my anxiety not quite gone but better than it had been in years, I sat it down for a while while I waited for some new meditations. I’m not gonna lie, I didn’t use the app for a long time after that, maybe 6 months or more but it never left my home screen, I never uninstalled it or anything. Eventually my anxiety started bothering me again back around Christmas so I pulled out my handy dandy anxiety busting meditation app only to find that the app that I BOUGHT for just a couple of dollars had been taken back from me and that I could now rent it BACK from them for a ridiculous amount of money a month. My progress is all still there, I’m just locked out of it. I understand the devs have a right to make money and to charge whatever they see fit. I just don’t think it’s right to sell someone something only to take it back away from them and try to rent it back out to them again for thousands of more dollars. If it was to be changed I feel like the changes (a monthly subscription fee) should have only applied to people who downloaded/installed the app AFTER the decision to change it from a flat price to a subscription fee had been made and not forced upon those who had already paid for the full version. I was originally gonna leave a review around Christmas when I discovered what had happened but was just blown away and I guess hurt. I didn’t want to talk or even think of it.

,369838631,,Breathing Zone,"I’ve been using this app for a week after comparing and test driving a few others.  I really appreciate the way you can start at a number of breaths and then the app progressively adjusts to the desired number of breaths.  

However, it could be better.  While I like how you  can set your target number of breaths, the app is missing the ability to control how long it takes for you to get to that desired number of breaths.  For example, if you’re doing a 20 minute session it would be nice to be able to set to have it slow down over the first 5 minutes... or 10... or whatever your preference is.  As it is, I know it goes slower but I have no idea how long it takes, nor is it possible to see how many breaths you’re doing at any particular time, which beings me to...

While the session screen is moderately cool with the pulsing orb thing, it’s kind of useless.  More helpful would be an option for an easy to see (always on while using the app) display of how much time is left in your current session as well as the current breaths per minute.  I’d like to be able to glance briefly at the screen and see how I’m doing and if I’m at my desired breath rate.  

Another minor complaint is that the app pauses very easily - by just touching the screen - which I’ve unintentionally done many times while in a session.  A more deliberately styled pause button would be better.  

Not a bad app but these adjustments would make the app perfect for me and one that I would use much more personally and be able to recommend much more highly to others.",4,jonomonbk,2018-04-10 06:07:35-07:00,neutral

,391564049,,Timer+ Timers and Stopwatches,"Hi, Pro subscriber here. I sent a message on August 23rd through the app about an issue I'm having but I still haven't received a response as of yet, so I'm following up with this review.

After recently updating my phone to iOS 18.6, the Timer+ app hasn't been working properly. The issue involves the widget or live update not showing the remaining time on the Lock Screen.

I have a 20-minute countdown timer that I use for time blocking purposes, which works fine if I don't add or subtract time from the 20-minute default. However, once I add time, the Lock Screen shows the initial time that the countdown started with, frozen at that time. This also happens with the quick timer feature.

I want to be able to lock my screen and not have the app open in order to see the remaining time, as it helps save battery. Otherwise, I can't really use the app since it requires too many steps to check the time, which would be disappointing. This has been my go-to productivity app for the past 3 years.

What's the point of paying for a Pro subscription if there's no support to help with issues? I'm frustrated that despite reaching out nearly two weeks ago, I haven't heard anything back.

This one provides a visual that I need — and things no longer get lost. 

—— Love, Love, Love that i can focus in on a single project with the 4-square visual of all the details. 

——     And LOVE that i can switch to the “Master List” or “Calendar” view to know exactly what i should be focusing on at any given point in time. 

Other good (and key) features is the ability to customize the quadrant for different projects — my “learning/development” goals are captured one way, my home and work “projects” have a more typical 4-square matrix.

Synching works well most of the time when all devices are in the home LAN but not so good at times or when not at home.  I can write some at home for an appointment on PC, then get to the appointment and it’s not there. No amount of Synch Now will synch it. ( and why are the synch commands different per platform?) 2. Often when I open the app on my phone it is immediately in drawing mode so that my first attempt to scroll results in a line instead of a scroll. I have to hit the undo key to erase the line and then hit the done button to get out of drawing mode. 3. Sometimes when I open the app on my phone or iPad, the text is corrupted with either lines missing , cut in half or with long bars where characters ought to be that looks sort of like barcodes in part of the document. To remedy I have to go to a different sheet or document and come back for it to render. 4.

I’m going to Hevy until you all can figure this one out. It’s just a shame because I think it’s the best workout app out there, but sometimes I just don’t really want to open my phone to add a set. It’s just a convenience thing.",3,Rich B-T,2025-09-14 09:01:18-07:00,negative

I have never bought the pro/lifetime version but with the basic version you have all that you need. I have logged over two years worth of workouts and I can even make up specific workouts, the only thing the basic version lacks is a lot of space for as many workout templates as you want to make, but you can get all that when you upgrade.

Although a bit of constructive criticism; live activities would be a great addition. It just seems like a natural thing to have while resting in between sets. Another thing that I think should be switched is notes and sticky notes. For some reason I can have multiple notes but one sticky note. It feels like the a user should have multiple sticky notes just how it is in real life. 

One bug I have noticed is even after deleting notes, I come next week and the same note is there. Pretty annoying because I have to guess when I wrote it (maybe add a date written feature) and if I should delete it.

Is the drop off of functionality from the desktop app to the iPhone and iPad app.  Functionality drops off the cliff and it’s very clunky.

I’ve grown used to the desktop app and browser version and I find myself using my laptop as much as I can instead of the app.  The iOS and iPad apps I use only if I have to.

I’m not sure what they did to this app, but the latest version is horrible. It starts up in half-screen mode and you can’t maximize it. I usually view projects in board view and loved the fact that previously you could just click on the “+” sign in each column to add a new task.

My entire days are structured around asana tasks, and I have the app open on my computer and phone for most of the day. The desktop version is amazing — no other task management software has the same capabilities or UX. However, the iOS app is seriously lacking:
1. “My tasks” view will not update task due dates or names unless you force quit the app. This means I have to force quit and reopen the app every time I check my tasks, in case due dates have changed
2. No offline mode
3. No weekly calendar view for tasks — only daily or monthly

There are a few other reviews talking about needing new content. Content has been added, but it’s been in very particular areas. There have been some new courses added for work life balance in recent years, new sleep sounds get added semi-regularly, and they’ve added the Therapy and AI features recently. While these options are great, they don’t quite align with my needs. My daughter uses the Sesame Street bedtime stories to help her fall asleep, but there haven’t been any new ones added in ages (nor has there been any unbranded children’s stories added to cover the gap)

It would also help if there was more content around temper and outbursts/triggers (and the SOS content is really limited here)

,519561306,,ATracker PRO Time Tracker,"I don’t want to sound dramatic but it actually did save my life.

To summarize myself, let me just say that I’m a nontraditional premedical student, meaning that I started college late and suddenly decided to become a doctor of all things.

I applied during the 2018/19 cycle and had one interview at UC Davis and was rejected. I was 29 yrs old at the time and it was just heart-wrenching to believe that everything that worked towards didn’t lead to an acceptance. I didn’t know what to do with my life anymore. It was so stressed and depressed and plus, I had used up so much of my money saved for this entire process that I was near broke.

I needed to inject some urgency and accountability back into my life. That’s when I decided to actively look for an app that would hold me accountable for the 24hrs in a day.

Long story short, I started to prepare for the MCAT again. With this app, I took the MCAT 2 more times. I did all of this studying while having a high pressure position at a fertility clinic. On February 25th of 2020, I got my score for my 4th MCAT and I got a very competitive score.

What does this mean? Well, now I have a shot at any US medical programs across the country and most importantly, I can take one step closer to reaching my dream of becoming a doctor.

It all started from using this app to measure literally EVERYTHING in my life: sleep, shower/washing up, socializing, study, eating, working, running errands, driving, gym etc... the list goes on. I wish there is a way to upload a pic of my schedule because it’s humanly impossible to have done what I did WITHOUT this app.

Yes, I accounted for literally every single minute of my life for about 1yr straight. Funny thing is that I’m certain that I will continue to use this app for the rest of my life.

ATracker, thank you so much for this app. Your app got me here. So many times, I wanted to give up. I lost count on how many times I thought about ending my life as well. I just keep at it and believed in my process. Today, my world looks so different. What time to be alive.

,519561306,,ATracker PRO Time Tracker,"ATracker Pro has enough features that if you log your time diligently and with intelligently chosen categories, you really will have charts and graphs showing you exactly where your time goes. The ability to categorize specific tasks into larger baskets, and then view your time expenditure in categories rather than tasks, is a particularly cool feature. The pie chart of time can show you for today, this week, this month, or a selected range of dates; I find this very handy. You can also see bar graphs of time spent in specific tasks by period of time. 

I’ve been using this for three months now. As a result I have quit social media, quit Netflix and Hulu, subscribed to the New York Times and the New Yorker, almost finished writing a book I had abandoned, and finally established a truly daily exercise routine (just walking for 40 minutes right now but I plan to upgrade to biking when I feel it is time).

It allows me to make notes of where my hang ups are and why I made choices!

I could not ask for a better product!!!

I am also so happy to see them come up with a payment model, as in the past it was free (with lesser options) and I ALWAYS have wanted to pay for it as it has given me SO much… let alone apple watch integration!!! WOW!!!

The recent update to the app has changed, removing videos that had visual examples which anyone can benefit whether you’re deaf or not. Visual information is important. 

You also need to caption your content. Im quite frankly tired of having to talk to people in customer service in general to ask for basic accessibility while dealing with people who don’t really care about it. 

Now there’s no more videos but all has been converted to audio files. 🙄

The UX is much too busy i can never easily show people anything when friends ask where is this. 

Popups are cheap attention grabs. And not fit for the high quality of isha content. 

The reason for popups in the app go away with a calendar of events page.  
That is much needed anyway. 

There is no real place in the app that shows the journey of the user. 

Streaks and schedule are a good start but the if a bug can erase a streak with ux bugs. Not good. 

 user can get los in clunky ux design. Of their own journey

Now we use this and it’s a world of difference. We set the timer and show him how much time he has and every so often show him how much time he has left during activity. When it gets close to being done I ask if he wants to want it explode. He understands when timer is done he is done with activity (usually playing for a few extra minutes) and is actually happy to go on with his routine. We have not had as much whining after timer is done and when we have it’s been minimal.

As it is, the Gallery feature is only so useful since you can easily switch to Photos to see the image.  2) More granular control over the intervals and total time.

,601617403,,ALO Wellness Club,"Love the app and the workouts, but only being able to use my tiny phone screen is a major downfall. Too often, I have to pause workouts to rewind, get closer to the screen to watch and then rewind to catch up with the move again. Not exactly the smooth flow to a workout that I want. 

The app and their website says you can cast to a device or TV, but it’s never worked for me and lots of others users have had similar issues in online forums. I’ve tried two different smart TVs, a fire stick, a Roku box and even just casting to my laptop for a slightly bigger screen. Nope! When trying to cast, I always get the same error message that there are no devices available despite everything being on the same network. I’m a super tech savvy person, have wasted an hour troubleshooting with the same results. Very frustrating. Others who have had success, say music is an issue.

Side note: is the app down today because so was using it and loving the yoga classes until today where I’m getting an error message?

Older comment: I was looking forward to use this app after trying the inversions yoga workout on Youtube until I subscribed for the free trial that never started! The app is also still LOCKED and it says I’m already subscribed so I should access the workouts I am paying for. Why isn’t it accessible?

,601617403,,ALO Wellness Club,"I really like this alo moves app.  I have been doing Yoga for 6 years and I guess over time I have become a bit particular.  I like my instructors to know what they are doing, and I want my yoga classes to be a relaxing and unwinding end of my day.  The Alo moves Yoga instructors are top notch. 

 But the second piece of what I am looking for in a class is relaxing atmosphere, which is where the music comes in.  The music should help me to relax and unwind.  Most of the music on the app is great, but some classes have music that includes lyrics.  Here is the problem.  When there are lyrics in the song, and the instructor is also speaking… that means there are two voices at the same time. Maybe it’s me, but my brain absolutely cannot make sense of two voices speaking/singing simultaneously.  It may sound weird but it gives me some sort of anxiety because my brain can’t choose what to listen to…which is the opposite of what I want in a yoga class.  I want to relax. 

Please take out songs with lyrics for yoga classes, or give us the ability to choose our style of music.  I will then give a 5 star rating, as I really do like this app.  Thanks!!",3,Amnicole21,2024-08-06 06:18:38-07:00,positive

	1.	Add More Fun Visuals: It would be awesome to have more playful or creative features, like uploading our own emojis or using fun reactions. It adds personality and engagement!
	2.	Organize Tasks by Categories/Files: I’d love a way to group tasks by themes or goals — like separate folders for work, study, travel, etc., each with different color codes (similar to Apple Calendar). Maybe this exists already, but I didn’t notice it.
	3.	Include a Habit Tracker + Insights: Adding a basic habit tracker would make the app feel more holistic — great for managing both tasks and personal growth. A simple stat dashboard showing completed tasks, overdue ones, and trends over time would be a helpful bonus. It would give users insight into their productivity and behavior.

,6443657745,,BB - Screen Time & App Blocker,"I almost never write reviews but this app is fantastic. There are plenty of apps that offer similar services, but this one offers the most for free, and the premium option is far more accessible as well as it’s a one-time purchase of a very reasonable $5. It also offer more privacy since you don’t make an account, everything is just stored locally on your device. The schemas are pretty straightforward to set up, and are definitely effective (especially with strict mode enabled). It’s also great that it works on iPads as well, exactly the same as on your phone, which I found was not the case with comparable (much more expensive!) apps.

I have just a couple of suggestions:
1. The ability to pause schemas for a set amount of time, e.g. “Pause for 30 minutes” or “Pause for 2 days.” Things like that. Or also pause until certain times like “Pause until 11:00” etc.
2. I don’t know how possible this is in terms of maintaining privacy, but it would be useful to have an in-app screen time tracking feature, where you could see how much time you spent in total, but also see apps marked as productive vs unproductive (either automatically marked by BB or manually selected by the user) to see how much productive vs unproductive screen time you had for that day/week, etc. 

I know it’s just one person building this app on the side, so I completely understand if these recommendations aren’t possible for such a small operation, or if they’d require functions the app simply can’t access due to iOS limitations, but they are just some ideas I had.

Overall, this app is amazing, especially considering its price (or lack thereof), and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to cut back on their screen usage. :)",5,co.var,2024-06-17 11:22:35-07:00,positive

2. There is no schema that allows someone to block for a time-period (e.g. 30 minutes). I feel like this should be a basic feature.",4,jacob92&3,2023-08-19 15:47:54-07:00,neutral

,6443657745,,BB - Screen Time & App Blocker,"I downloaded and got the pro version of this app a while ago, and I am impressed by it's powerful capabilities. You can set up more than just a single Downtime with this app. Imagine having lots of Downtimes at different times of the day, each one having a group of apps, like social media and entertainment, blocked during the period that you set. The app can go further with the power of Shortcuts. I mostly use this app to block apps while a focus is turned on, since most of my focus settings have scheduled times anyway. And even though this app doesn't sync to the cloud, I can set the same groups of apps to be blocked when a focus is turned on across multiple devices, so when I turn on a focus, the same groups of apps can be blocked, this works because focus settings can be set up to sync across iCloud. I have a suggestion, it would be nice to lock my settings with a passcode and prevent the app from being deleted. Overall, this is an awesome productivity tool that I will use throughout my day, along with what's already available with the default Screen Time capabilities.",5,DJAllegretto,2023-04-14 17:36:37-07:00,positive
,6443657745,,BB - Screen Time & App Blocker,"This app is the best for any screen time management. I was finding no apps that were in my price range that had features I needed. This app has triggers that activate when an app is used for a certain amount of time, and triggers for a schedule, but the best part is Shortcuts integration. This allows you to turn on and off blocking for the apps you want basically however you wanted to, like by location or through any Shortcut. I am more than happy to support this app, and I will recommend it to anyone who wants to have some type of customized screen time solution. Especially with the price being the cheapest, it’s just the best option. It isn’t the prettiest, but it gets the job done.

There was one thing I wanted to ask the developers for, when I said it wasn’t the prettiest. The design of the screen that pops up when you open a restricted app doesn’t look great. There’s a lot of text that just doesn’t seem to have a purpose, and the logo being front and center bugs me. The app still works, and I’d take this app over any other app for screen time management, but please make it look nicer.

,6443657745,,BB - Screen Time & App Blocker,"I’ve tried all the other apps (Opal, OffScreen, ScreenZen, Brick). All the other ones either offer scammy subscriptions, or cannot block based on schedule, or UX wise just are not there.

This app ticks all the boxes. Easily worth the purchase of pro. I’m usually very hesitant about spending the money but not on an app like this. And if you paid the subscription free for other apps, you’re going to pay that amount in a month or two anyway.

Initially I was turned off by the app icon but they provide a much better icon when you sign up for premium. They also let you customize the Lock Screen which is a very nice touch. I would prefer the premium icon being an option there.

They don’t have the feature in Opal where you can just block everything by default and specify what you DON’T want blocked. But honestly, you don’t really need it. Block all the categories, and then unselect the apps you don’t need. Same thing.

I would definitely suggest changing that default app icon. It just doesn’t give a good first impression for how good the app is.

The app “Brick” gives a way to block Safari as well via shortcut automation, along with detailed instructions in the app as to how to do this. This would be a nice future addition.

The iOS app picker is buggy no matter which app you use. Don’t blame the app dev for that. But once you set things up how you want them, you mostly don’t have to deal with it.

I don’t want to do 100 habits daily.

,6444819615,,Cape: Screen Time Master,"Heard about this app from tips on how to hide stuff. My parents are insanely strict and invasive, scouring my phone every night and reading through all my text convos. This app. Is. A. Lifesaver. I would recommend the pro version to anyone who wants peace of mind, (at the time of this review it’s only like $8 and it’s a ONE TIME PURCHASE NOT A SUBSCRIPTION.) The pro version has a lot more app space (5 completely hidden vs 50), and can lock with a passcode. However, my favorite feature is the camo ability. If you’re being forced to open the app in front of others, you can enter in the decoy password instead of the real one and the app becomes a note app. It makes it just look like a password protected note app and you can even change the app icon to look like a notebook. The BEST thing that I use this app for isn’t even an advertised feature. I call it my panic button. In shortcuts you can make a fake app cover (tutorials on how to do this are online), and mine functions as an app I can press that instantly hides certain app groups.

,6446800962,,Roots: Screen Time Control,"I have a pretty bad phone addiction, and I got Roots to support me by offering the time limits for apps and also blocked off time. I paid for the subscription so I could have monk mode and the most access to Roots’ offerings. I had to stop using app specific time limits because I would find myself locked out of apps that I needed after only being awake for three minutes. It would tell me that I timed out of my four hours of time limit for a work necessary app at 6:03 AM when I hadn’t even opened that app. the screen would have the accurate time for my screen usage, but the time limit would be locked anyways. And here I am sitting on my lunch, hoping to have 15 minutes of downtime before heading back into my stressful workday to find that my apps are locked once again when I have no active time limit, and no active blocked out time running. I paid around $30 to find my phone bricked more often than not and while it has significantly reduced my phone time, I also want to be able to use my phone when I find it appropriate. I really hope that these issues can be fixed, and I will be seeking some sort of refund or at least some amount of cheat days added to my account because I should not have to use an entire cheat day that I earned by following my goals because I want to be on my phone for 15 minutes and I’m finding myself locked out.

The app’s design is sleek, intuitive, and highly customizable, making it easy to track habits and stay on top of my goals. I especially love the ability to set specific goals and track progress over time—it’s a game-changer for habit-building.

However, the one area where Grit falls just short of perfection is the lack of support for non-repeatable, one-time tasks. While the app excels at habit tracking, it would be incredibly useful to have the ability to add one-off tasks that don’t factor into the overall habit metrics. This functionality would consolidate all my to-do items into one app and eliminate the need for other tools like Apple’s Notes.

This minor shortcoming is the only thing keeping Grit from being a perfect five-star, daily-use application for me. With the addition of non-repeatable tasks, this app would truly be unbeatable.

I tried to play this daily for the past 6 days, I think I got 4 days in, but I just don’t think it’s beneficial for me.  While I’m playing I feel anxious and agitated. I also hold my breath. The pace is so fast, the angle of the phone is not good for my neck or wrists and as I do better it speeds up so I never feel successful. The repetitive sounds may be designed to be a purposeful distraction, but I find them so irritating. There’s the ‘oh crud’ when you miss your target (but it’s strange b/c I am hitting the thumb button but it is almost off the screen and  but not quite but still registers as having missed it) and there’s the loud command not to miss the power zones &  “you’re slowing down!!!” After missing only one. At the pace it goes and with multitasking happening of course I’m going to miss one or two, I don’t need that startling distracting reminder which will only make me miss more. The game is repetitive and it continuously has me targeting blue creatures—don’t know if that’s by design because on the rare occasion I’d need to target a red or a yellow creature I often forgot and went for blue by mistake b/c I was so used to it. There’s also all these extraneous bells and whistles with the points, purchasing different characters and uniforms and a farm but I don’t know what any of that is or how it would benefit me from the standpoint of treating adhd. It actually seems more like a gratuitous dopamine fix that I’m not interested in. The stats that are shared on my progress mean very little to me because they aren’t explained in detail.

,6447322997,,EndeavorOTC®: Outplay ADHD,"Don’t rely on the negative reviews from people who forgot how the App Store works with free trials and automatic subscriptions, or the people complaining that the game isn’t the most fun. It’s definitely fun for treatment and I noticed a difference after my very first session. It gets harder as you improve to keep challenging you, the harder the game gets the easier my life gets. One of my biggest struggles with ADHD is executive disfunction and all the extra time it takes me to start and complete tasks due to all my dilly dallying, committing to this treatment plan has cut down that time DRASTICALLY as well as all of the anxiety and depression that used to result from the struggle. Now I just plan something and I do the thing? I feel so efficient and my confidence has significantly improved. Bonus tip: if you meditate or have a brief period of non-sleep deep rest within four hours of a session (or any kind of study session) it helps your brain to really rewire all of those changes in your brain aka it makes your brain a better sponge for everything you are learning.

***UPDATE*** 
After having this app for almost a year I will not be renewing it or recommending it to anyone. Once all of the levels are unlocked there is no further skill development other than the game getting faster and faster in order to further challenge the user. There is not enough variety in the levels, you are just supposed to play them over and over.

Equally importantly, it’s a fun game in its own right. It would’ve been easy to just apply the attention mechanic onto a very simple set of repeating tracks, but the designers have gone a lot further that that with the engaging interstitials, worlds, and characters. It feels as though it’ll be much easier for me to keep up the habit of playing daily when the story and design are this much more captivating than your average casual racing game.

As someone who would ordinarily feel guilty about spending 25 min/day playing on my phone, I’m glad that this feels so much for thoughtful and polished than most games of a similar nature, it somehow legitimizes it for me.

,6448239603,,App Lock,"I bought the paid version. In response to a previous review regarding the free version: think about the value of your private information. The price of the pro version is WELL worth the cost of the upgrade.  

Team, this software is fantastic. Congratulations on a great application!

The tweaks: Say you use the facial recognition (FR) feature of iOS to unlock an app you have locked down. FR evaluates your face, matches it, and redirects you to App Lock. 

I am using the app on an iPhone 15 Pro. My text display is set to large. Also I’ll refer to the control that displays the name of the app you were just using as the “back” text. I’m unaware of the proper name.

Tweak number one: If you have a larger font set, the prompt that tells you to hit the “back” text is too large for the space it occupies. Consider making the prompt legible in such cases. 

Tweak number two: Allow that prompt to go away, either by expiration after a small number of uses or via toggle in settings. Once people catch on about how to use the app, perhaps they don’t need to be continually shown. 

Tweak number three: If the Dynamic Island is in use, the “back” text disappears. The current effect is now you have a prompt pointing to a control that isn’t there. Users must resort to swiping up and re-entering the app they attempted to open; it is now unlocked.

,6448239603,,App Lock,"Just tried this out and my first assumption was: all the thief needs to do is to delete the lock app and then they have access to everything that was locked. Nope! Your only option is to remove it from the Home Screen. As long as the app is “on” (locking apps), you cannot delete it. Cool. I like this. 

Now for the downside. In order to use any of the apps that you’ve locked you have to first open up this app, turn off the locks for all your apps, then use your previously locked app(s), then you have to go back to this app to re-enable the lock. There should be a way to open a locked app and then enter a pin or face/Touch ID to access it (much how apps with this built-in operate). This is too cumbersome and too many steps for frequently used apps. I don’t like this. 

What this is great for is apps that don’t offer this additional level of protection. Thankfully a lot of apps do (like bank apps) do. This uses Apple’s screen time functionality to lock you out of the apps you choose which is great, but again.. too many steps. The developer needs to work with Apple to find a way to bypass the lock without having to do the round trip steps.

There is another “App Lock“ offered in the App Store, that allows for this possibility, i.e. changing the app's icon to something like a calculator, for example, but, strangely enough, does not allow the user to change the app's name. Even though the app's icon (and name) can be hidden from view in your cell phone main screen, the app is readily available via a search of your installed apps, where it shows the icon and name (and it even starts with an “A” so…). I installed this app, and use it constantly, because my son (who is a programmer) recommended it to me, and I thought that I had achieved almost total security from this standpoint. However, a few days ago, talking to an Uber driver, regarding the cases in which people have had their bank accounts cleaned out via the app installed in their cell phones, he mentioned to me that I could install an app that would hide, the icons, the conclusion to this being that, if an Uber driver knows about this type of app, undoubtedly crooks would also be aware of these applications and would search for them in the cell phone and, if they also have you, they can beat the pulp out of you until you tell them the PIN and, once they have it, they can deactivate the “Hide“ feature of the app, and then proceeded to get from you the various passwords and PINs needed to transfer money out of your accounts (some of which will even be, no doubt, set up for facial recognition). The app should allow the user to completely disguise it, BOTH THE ICON AND THE NAME, so that it could not be easily found and deactivated, thust increasing security considerably.  Much easier to ""explain"" that you do not have any financial apps installed ""because of the dangers involved..."".

Now, for the programming flaws:

- The PIN used to lock/unlock apps is the same used to access the app itself. They should be allowed to be different, i.e. have one “master pin“ to activate/deactivate the various features in the app and other pin(s) to block/unblock block apps.

- Finally, when when one is selecting apps to be blocked, or hidden, the program has a rather disconcerting tendency to return to the main app categories screen when one has already chosen a category and began to choose individual apps to be blocked or hidden, and you have to start all over again.

It would be fantastic if the developers could fix at least the main problem (i.e. disguising the app itself so that it would not provide any clue as to its true identity and purpose)",4,Gabriel Lanata,2024-06-29 16:43:41-07:00,neutral

The only suggestion I have for the team is to either give more options for automation strategy (being able to choose  a building type I don’t want it to build, for example), or to reduce how often workshops are built by the automation. Where I’m at in the game, workshop products don’t seem to do anything and use my valuable gathering resources, so I end up deleting those buildings to build more rock mines or tree gathering buildings.

That said, I really wish this app had some other features (because now I have to use other apps in supplement to this one, which sometimes makes it a bit inconvenient). 
— I wish the in app sound would offer more than just relaxing nature noises but rather a clock/timer tick sound or a water droplet sound that CONTINUES to play even if you exit the app/start playing music. 
— This is one of the biggest things- the timer should be able to show and continue running in the Lock Screen or at least create an interactive widget feature. If I close out of the app and I play music or something, the notification simply says “timer will keep running” rather than a current count down of your task / and the ability to mark as complete/etc. This is the biggest inconvenience of the app compared to other promodoro or task management apps.

As far as the app- I use it daily. What makes it different is the time shown for each task and the total time for a group of tasks. For example, if I need to do my morning tasks I know it’s a total of 1.5hrs, but I know I have to leave the house in 1hr- then I can adjust the list of tasks and move the tool to show the exact time ie. 8:43AM that it would take to complete all the morning tasks.

I love knowing how long it will take to complete a group of tasks and when that group would be complete. I have over 20+ tasks in a given day. Llama Life is the only way I get these things done!

And it’s not a reflection on me. Sometimes a task just takes longer or an interruption happens. And the day isn’t a failure. 

Llama Life has just enough flexibility to adapt to the day’s situation. But not so much that you could go down a rabbit hole playing around in the app instead of moving through the day’s to-do’s.

,6454469750,,Llama Life ADHD Routine & Task,"I’ve been using Llama Life on desktop for about ten months, and it simplifies and gameifies the dreaded daily to-do list. So to now have this handy system on my phone really transforms the entire day for me! I’m able to manage my tasks as I’m doing them in different rooms of the house, or even out and about running errands! As an ADHDer, this is especially helpful as I can get detailed so easily and succumb to distractions and side quests!

My favorite part of Llama Life is how they’ve managed to make something like a boring to-do list into something fun! Confetti, chimes, and the colors and themes just make it more appealing. I save my preset lists for routine-setting, check over my reports to see if I stuck to my time estimation, and even use their AI-assisted emoji matching to make those tasks even more fun.

,6454469750,,Llama Life ADHD Routine & Task,"For years, there has been a 30/30-shaped hole in my heart, and I have bounced from app to app searching for a worthy replacement. I found the Llama Life website a few weeks ago and was disappointed to see that it was via Internet only, but then I was almost immediately thrilled to read that an iOS app was to release within the month. Talk about perfect timing! 

Words cannot convey how much this app means to me. As an ADHD woman whose sense of time is vestigial at best, finding a app that works with my brain is like birthday and Christmas rolled into one. 30/30 worked for me, and then it just… went away. 😭 I mourned that app the way other people might mourn lost family members. There is no telling how much time and money I’ve wasted searching for a replacement, but the search is finally over! HUZZAH. (That’s what the kids say nowadays, right??)

To the developers of Llama Life, thank you thank you THANK YOU for all of your hard work. All of the features, the colors, emoji, the ability to break tasks down, to save routines, to easily enter times, the end time estimate, the planned vs. actual time, the divider bar… This app feels like it was designed especially for me.

Thank you for the adjustments.

Onboarding literally asks if you are colorblind, and regardless of what you say you are repeatedly shown color based puzzles without any patterns/textures to assist those who cannot see colors. Could be matching games based on colors, or games where words are a color and you are supposed to know if the color matches the word. Just not a great showing to be aware enough this condition exists, to ask about it, and to do nothing within the app itself to support users suffering from it.",5,x B0B x,2024-07-29 09:31:51-07:00,negative

,6472498233,,Propel: ADHD Games for Adults,"After downloading and playing this game for ~ 45 minutes, I came across several claims that caused me to question the integrity of the developers. 

1) upon opening the game, one of the first screens claims something to the effect of, “#1 downloaded ADHD app/game.” Given that Propel currently has <600 reviews and the App Store doesn’t indicate # of downloads, it seems safe to say that statement is misleading. (I understand that such statements have become more normalized, but that doesn’t make the en any less deceitful.)

2) After answering the demographic and “let’s create your plan” questions, I was faced with the option to sign up for a “3-day free trial” followed by a $49.99 annual subscription fee. I clicked “see other plans” and was surprised to find the annual plan offered for $39.99 “(no free trial)”. Charging subscribers that opt to use the trial $10 more than those that subscribe sans the trial does not equal “free”; rather, it equals $10/3 days, or $3.33/day.

3) Finally, I played almost every game at least twice.  I’m apparently quite good compared to all the other users because I scored better than 93-95% players on EVERY game I played…including the game that I quit four times (number sort with the moving tiles). Quitting the game resulted in a ZERO score every time, and I STILL scored higher than 93% AND 94% of other players! According to this game, I’m decently bright (it is the #1 downloaded ADHD game 😉) but I can’t figure out how I could improve my standing -within minutes! - with the lowest possible score.    Assuming that the lowest possible score is ZERO (were negative scores possible, I would have received one based on how many moves I made before quitting), it’s not statistically possible for someone who scores 0 (the lowest possible score) to have outperformed 93% of users, because no one can score worse than 0. 
This statistical & coding oversight led me to conclude that the ego-boosting performance stats at the end of games are in place only to keep players playing. Presenting users with a sense of achievement is valuable…especially to the developer. 

If the developer is truly interested in helping those with ADHD (or anyone), they need to attend to the studies that indicate that honest, direct feedback is far more beneficial than sugar-coated or insincere. Instead of spitting out false numbers, consider offering tips on how to improve their gameplay. You ask for and benefit from in-app feedback so you can improve your game; extend the same courtesy to your users.",1,selah54935,2025-04-23 22:47:42-07:00,negative

I know that I really need personalized help somebody to be interested and ask me what’s going on and ask follow-up questions and pitch ideas on how to move forward and so I looked at AI assisted task managers and after testing about four different ones I landed on this one.

If most people using this app are like me, I’m very sensitive to sound and generally only find one or two acceptable. If I could hear samples of the premium options, I’d be much more likely to purchase them. Also, since I do have such a sensitivity to sound, the short sound clips in the free version are distracting.

Unlike other “productivity apps”, I can feel the science and teachings of Atomic Habits behind this. I can already feel it working. As a person with ADHD, the accountability partner area is genius!

Most other apps will start you off with limited features and allow you to upgrade to more features, not give you features and then limit you to just one unless you upgrade. 

I don’t mind paying a one time fee, I don’t mind there being ads, but I bought the book and move it, I don’t think the app does enough to warrant $60/year!

A) If I want a reminder to practice a habit, I can just set a repeating calendar reminder on my phone (completely free). The app would need to have significant functionality beyond tracking a habit to be worth paying for the Pro version. Maybe I didn't use the app long enough to discover more functions, but it seems as though the only other useful functions the app provides are the ability to select an accountability partner, access to daily tips (see next comment), and a self-evaluation function.

B) All or most of the articles and tips included with the app can be found on Clear's website or in the Atomic Habits book. Yes, the app makes it easier and faster to access the information; however, having the information slightly more accessible is not saving me $120 a year.

But there’s one pretty significant feature missing, and it’s an option to pause habits and not lose your streak. For example if you become sick or go on a vacation and you can’t follow your regular habits and routine. It makes me feel guilty for losing my streaks, but like sometimes your routine has routine has to change for a few days! I feel like this would be fairly easy to implement and would make the app almost perfect to me. 

A way to set goals to be for a set amount of time (like exercising for 30 min for example) but still be able to check it off just once and not have to check off all the minutes would also be great. If my goal is to exercise for 30 min, I’m gonna do it all at once. I don’t want to have the click the check mark a bunch of times to get to it completed.

1 - you can’t track using decimals. So if you walk 0.5 miles you’re forced to either not track it or round up. Both bad options. Same would go for tracking drinks, water intake etc.

2 - you can’t archive habits. So if you have a short term goal you’re working on, once it’s completed you either have to delete it or just have it cluttering the screen. Another major con for me.

Otherwise it has a lot of good features and is worth the $20 for the year but I will continue searching for something that has a little more flexibility in tracking individual habits.",3,savannahrose100,2025-01-30 11:55:52-07:00,neutral

,6477306136,,Blokd - App Blocker,"I like how this app is cheaper for what you get than the leading competitor, and it was what convinced me to get it. Keep in mind that the website advertises this app as a “subscription free” service but thats not 100% accurate. Upon initial download, it actually charged $10/m or $60 a yr to allow all apps to be blocked but allowed for exceptions, whereas the free version required you to manually select which apps to block, with a max of 50. 

It seems that they have recently adjusted that number according to their changelog. I think for transparency, you (the customer) should be aware that this payment gate exists somewhere in the app. I don’t know if the leading competitor also has a hidden paywall because they too advertise no subscription fees.

The temptation to use some apps again is too strong, and I always fall back into that trap. It truly takes discipline. But the thing about owning this blok is that it’s actually forced me to become more disciplined. With blok, I can have a physical barrier and better enforce my app limitations in a way that I can’t easily fall into temptations to open them again.

,6479611902,,Superhappy Screen Time Blocker,"so, before this app, i used screenzen and opal. opal i used when ai coaches weren't paywalled, and it was mostly good, but the blocking was done in sessions, so there was nothing to stop me from binging in between them. screenzen had a lot of neat features, but what i really needed wasn't a block screen, it was to be actively discouraged from using it. 
when you have a serious addiction to an app (mine is tiktok) mindfulness exercises and long block screens only get you so far. having to talk to the ai and actually justify whether or not i absolutely need to open something has already been a huge barrier between me and mindlessly opening it. ive been using the drill sergeant and it's so so helpful! i love that you can also modify how it behaves towards you. i made my sergeant a bit stricter in tone, because a little bit of curtness is a lot more discouraging and really makes you consider if you absolutely must open it. highly recommend!!",5,wizard11-45,2025-04-06 10:13:24-07:00,positive

Sorry, but that is not a free app. If you’re going to run a business and advertise, at least be truthful- because then instead of stopping people’s time on their phones, you’re giving people pointless time on their phone downloading an app that isn’t free after they commented and waited for a response.

,6479611902,,Superhappy Screen Time Blocker,"I initially got Superhappy to help cut down on my screen time, and it’s been great for that. But what really surprised me is how much it’s helped with other habits, too. I used to order takeout from apps like Postmates and GrubHub 2-3 times a day, but since using Superhappy, I haven’t ordered once. It’s actually helped me stop late-night food orders and made me more motivated to cook at home.

What I love most is how the app is there at just the right time—when I’m opening a social media app out of boredom or when I’m thinking about ordering food. It’s like a gentle reminder that I don’t really need to, and it helps me stay on track.

Honestly, I think Superhappy could be used for more than just screen time. It has the potential to change how people use their phones in a bigger way by helping them build healthier habits overall.

One suggestion I have is maybe adding more options when it comes to blocking apps. For example, I enjoy playing chess, but I can get frustrated when I lose. It would be cool if Superhappy could remind me to stay cool and enjoy the game instead of fully blocking the app.

Overall, Superhappy has really made a difference in my daily life, and I’d recommend it to anyone looking to create better phone habits.",5,Justbeian,2024-10-12 13:48:49-07:00,positive
,6479611902,,Superhappy Screen Time Blocker,"Ai model is outdated, effective enough for simple conversations, but cannot handle context or memory well. 

Developers want $75/year to use their app to block more than one app on your phone, significantly more than what their competitors charge.

There are many easy ways around getting apps unlocked. For those who need serious deterrence from using their problem apps, it will not be adequate. 

My recommendation, for those who are serious about blocking their phone: I have been using the ‘freedom’ app for about a month now (I’m not getting paid to say this). It cost $40 for a year, and is much much much more effective at limiting what apps I can use and when. While it does lack the same ability to have a conversation to unlock your apps, there is still a function to unlock apps for a certain amount of time, or you can take that away from yourself.

So while I think this app has its place for those who don’t want serious limits and don’t mind paying extra, it is definitely not the best product on the market, in my opinion. 

TL;DR: Superhappy doesn’t allow you to truly block your apps and is overpriced. Check out the freedom app and others.",3,gayniggabuttsex,2025-04-06 21:20:53-07:00,negative

,6479611902,,Superhappy Screen Time Blocker,"This app is meant to create a barrier from opening apps you’ve registered as “distracting” during time blocks you’ve setup. It does that somewhat effectively since you have to have a low effort argument with a chatbot to use those apps during those blocks. 

Where this app fails is with the goal setting and its tracking of your app usage- it only tracks the time you’ve requested for unlocks, not your actual screen time with say Instagram. So the stats it collects are inaccurate at best, meaningless at worst. 

Great app if you want to make it harder to open an app like Instagram- you will have to argue with a chatbot every single time.

for most of my life, I had hoped for technology to evolve so that it became self limiting because according to dudes that were kind of big brain, but also racist like, Kant, too much freedom is not a good thing. Creativity needs discipline and discipline needs limits. 

Do not kid yourself, unless you were a freak of nature, you do not use your phone and appropriate amount. 

I think all of us in an ideal world would like to be free from the phone. I think we would all be better. People were legitimately comfortable with the chatter and silence of our own minds. 

The closest you will come to using your phone appropriately will likely be a direct result of using this app. 

It requires reflection because it necessitates that you have a dialogue about what you are doing.

Original Review: When I select for it to block ALL social on my iPhone, for some reason I’m still able to access Instagram during a time that all social should be blocked. I can see it working appropriately for all other social platforms. Even if I unfold Social, I can see that all forms of Instagram are blocked but I’m still able to access it.

What really makes this app shine is its beautiful UI and blocking your apps (which a lot of other apps on the App Store do) in a very nice way, allowing you to take breaks, which is really nice. Not only does it have a scheduling feature (basically required for an app like this), but it also allows you to control adding breaks and controlling the strictness of the breaks.

Really good app, great job with it! The only issue (not really big) is that some of the more advanced features are gated behind an $80 lifetime subscription. But it seems to me that you don't need those features, so the app is not really lacking. Five stars!",5,Quality reviewer,2025-03-24 03:08:43-07:00,positive

	1.	App Blocking Feature: I would like the ability to block specific apps for my child or allow only one app at a time. However, sometimes the app behaves incorrectly—for example, when I select an allowed app, it ends up blocking everything. On the other hand, when I choose to allow only system apps, it permits all apps instead. This behavior should be corrected to work as expected.
	2.	Homework Time Display Issue: When I set “Homework Time” for my child, the app does not display it correctly. Instead, no matter what schedule I create, it always shows “Bedtime” to the child. It would be great if the app could properly display “Homework Time” when selected.

,670870972,,Productivity - Daily Planner,"This truly is the very best application to plan and manage your life. I upgraded to the Pro version after only a week of using it.

I have been using this app for about a year now, and this latest update is very beautiful!

There are still a few tweaks/implementations that need to be addressed:
- Remove the login screen whenever we load the app.
- Morning Routines, Daily Checkin, and Reflection reminders do not work properly. I set the time to be different than the default time, but it kept on reminding me at the app's default set time.
- Routines that are tied to a Major Goal do not automatically go away after the goal has been achieved; it remained as a weekly routine indefinitely.
*** Adjusting the routines' time and days of the week does not sync up with the Calendar app; we have to manually edit those times and days on the Calendar app as well if whenever we make adjustment to the routine. I must say that this lack of sync function had irritated me the most, as making minor changes and adjustments to our routines are important to making progress toward our goals. The end-goal should be fixed, but the routines to get there should be flexible.

Even with all the weak points mentioned above (which could be improved in future updates), I still would rate this app as a 5 Stars app. It is definitely one of the most important apps on my iPhone.

I highly recommend anyone that is serious in personal development to purchase the Pro version of this app. It will definitely produce positive changes to your life, if you make a daily habit of using it!",5,AstralFlare,2016-10-17 21:29:57-07:00,positive

The developers have been providing the same response for years regarding their subscription model, stating it’s sustainable. But it’s not sustainable for customers. Subscriptions add up quickly, and an individual customer only has so much income for companies to eat up each month.

Already having NFC tags, I was on the lookout for an app. I went through a few, and this is the first one that doesn’t make focusing a hassle. Select what I want blocked, tap the nfc tag, study.

One feature that may be useful is an emergency override, but make it annoying to use, so it can’t be used whenever, like waiting 10 minutes, only allowing it once, etc. But other than that, this app is amazing!",5,bubbleface960,2025-06-09 16:01:45-07:00,positive

Still this is easy enough to work around, and everything else has been perfect!  Highly recommend this over many apps that try to do the same thing - but in a much clunkier way and for $50 or more.

1. Add a setting toggle to revert to forced NFC scan behavior vs allowing for tap to start/stop. 

2. Change app selection so you can create profiles from choosing what you want Allowed vs choosing only what you want to block. It would be lovely to be able to create a profile where I only have to pick one app and that’s the only app that will work, all else blocked.",5,LDLW_,2025-02-11 03:44:44-07:00,positive

,691121579,,AdBlock,"Pros: it works. Well. Very few ads slip through, it even blocks them on apps which can turn some freeware games into actually enjoyable games when you don’t get bombarded with ads every few seconds. It’s also very set it and forget it, only once in a couple of months will i go in and toggle or change something.
The meh:
Adding exceptions is a nice feature but can be finnicky at times. I don’t blame the app for this i don’t think there’s a better way to do this on mobile. 
Youtube’s app has the ads baked in so much that you will still get ads even with this adblocker (you can block the ads with exceptions but the videos will stop loading too) BUT the adblocker WORKS on the browser version of youtube so i just stopped using the app altogether and use the ad-free broswer version.
The cons(?): if i understand how this adblocker works, it redirects ALL your phone’s data requests through their servers where it blocks certain url’s from sending data back to your phone. That does mean that theoretically the app makers see ALL your data. Depending on how you feel about this it’s either a dealbreaker or an afterthought.

,719462746,,Flat Tomato (Time Management),"Solid little app. Birds chirping at break times is a nice touch. 

I am adding new info to this review, of the paid version. 

I feel I am more productive and focused as a result of using this app. I have integrated it with my calendar (it required an email to the developer to figure out how to do so), and it is nice to see my Pomodoro's appear on my calendar as a sign of work well done. 

In my previous review (see below), I said that I did not use this often. I am using it more now. And getting more things done. 

A couple of items that are puzzling to me: the awards and feedback and are you cons of stars and moons are not clear to me. 

Also, sometimes the sound cuts out, or the select task option (below the clock on main screen) disappears. Those are minor cosmetic issues that don't stop the app from working very well, but do detract from the final polish of the app. 

Finally, this app asks me to review it. So I finally did… And find that I DID review it earlier. Ah well.

OLD COMMENTS ABOUT OLD VERSION: I don't use it daily, or even nearly daily, but do use it as a mental reboot aid at times when I've been too distracted. It's excellent to help me get on task/stay on task. Also good for getting started on or working through imposing tasks or things I am mentally resisting.

,726780077,,Brainbuddy: Quit Porn Now,"I have struggled with online addiction since I was a boy. When I was 10yrs old, my wannabe rocker father introduced me to that world because he thought it was “cool” and “what guys do.” Over time I was afraid of how it was making me feel, and I asked him and my mother to put parental controls on our home computer. They both refused. I’m 26 now, and I have battled this off and on the entire time. Sometimes I’d get away from it for months, years, but it kept coming back. This app helped me get away from it once, and during a recent relapse it is helping me get away from it again. What I love about the app is the outreach and support it offers from like-struggling people. You are anonymously together in your fight and able to encourage each other through an issue so difficult to seek encouragement and support for in your day to day life. The application costs a little money to utilize, but it is a small price to pay compared to the cost of addiction. Act now. Fix it now.

What I appreciate most is that Brainbuddy doesn’t just focus on stopping porn — it helps you understand yourself better, build healthier habits, and improve your mindset.

Over time, my journey became more spiritual and personal. I started turning to prayer, reading books, and speaking to God in sujood instead of relying on numbers. But that’s a sign the app worked — it helped me graduate from external motivation to internal strength.

At least add a little music in the background to lessen that.  Also, some of the voices are just not good voices for mindfulness.  The app itself is amazing and by far the best I found especially for learning mindfulness!  I hate to even take off a star... but the fact is... it could definitely be improved upon.  Please don’t let this app just ‘be’.  Make it even better because it’s an amazing tool in recovery!!

,804284729,,Mindfulness Coach,"I’ve read many books, watched many videos and have taught an Eckhart Tolle group of over 200 k people online daily for 4-5 years. This app, hands down is the best tool to step into mindfulness with, beginners or advanced. If Tolle, Donald Walsh etc and nonduality is not getting you anywhere or even if it has, try this. This app is FREE. The people who made this app didn’t make it to monetize off of. They’ve made it to be effective and it is exactly that, effective. You just might be really pleasantly surprised.

The only thing that I would like to see fixed is the counter that keeps track of how many days in a row you use the app. It doesn’t work a lot of times, maybe it is to do with change of month and new year. 

I have used this app every day for almost 4 months and the counter keeps resetting. 

Other than this very minor issue it is hands down the very best mindfulness app that I’ve used over the years. There are also links in the app to get more free exercises that are really awesome as well from iRest. Do yourself a favor and try this app. 

Just because it’s free doesn’t mean it’s poorly designed or that it doesn’t work as well as other mindfulness apps. I have several apps including Wake Up and this one is just as good and effective as that expensive app. 

One other thing that I would love to see covered by this app is “non-striving and non-doing”. If these are understood mindfulness is a cake walk. It is also the same as Wu Wei non-striving and non-doing. Everything that we need is right here in this moment, anything else is a desire and is mind-made suffering because we struggle to achieve a goal in the hopes that when we get to that goal we’ll be happy or when “I retire” I’ll be happy or when “I hit the lotto, I’ll be happy”. 

All those goals that we rely on to make us happy in a future moment is like having a stick with a carrot dangling out in front of us, and we constantly try to catch it or get to, not realizing that the chasing after it, is what creates a LOT of suffering AND takes us away from this moment. 

If we can see this and intentionally just Stop chasing a future moment and be Here Now, we can have peace, joy and contentment. It really is that simple. 

Thank you so much to the developers and VA for making this free and available to everyone, veteran or civilian. 🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️",5,Dghhjddhghj,2023-01-03 17:57:22-07:00,positive

,866450515,,Forest: Focus for Productivity,"I’ve had this app since 2017 and used it on and off through college and my working life. It’s one of the best apps on my phone, and I don’t regret paying for it back then. 

Pros: the tree variety is great, especially within the past year with the new monthly challenge plant varieties. The ambient sounds are good. The graphs are great if you use tags and unobtrusive if you don’t. It has a lot of small quality of life features that are really great, like the ability to keep the screen on so you can see the timer running, the ability to run a whitelist of apps in case you need to consult something on your phone quickly without your plant dying, and the fact that you can set the app to keep counting time length. The achievement system helps newbies quickly diversify tree species available to them. The new daily challenges award a small amount of the paid currency so with patience you can unlock previous time limited trees. It’s also significantly spread up collecting gold, which is nice for a casual like me. Most of the tree species have stages of growth depending on how long you plant them, so even with only a few trees to start with you can get some visual interest going. I like planting a variety of the more realistic trees so my little monthly forest is biodiverse, but I appreciate there’s also weird and whimsical trees. There really is a tree or two for everyone.

Cons: The company behind this app has decided to monetize it more, in the form of a paid subscription model instead of a one-time purchase. I understand why they’re doing this, and I think it’s going to be good for the app, but on principle I won’t be using it as I dislike subscription models for productivity apps. Hopefully the free version won’t be too inaccessible. Also, the daily challenge prize collection glitches sometimes, and it’s not actually clear on the screen where to tap to collect it and move on.

Wishlist: Like another commenter, I’d really like the ability to set a little chime when a planting is done that makes it through silent mode. I always have my phone on silent though so maybe this is on me! Other than that, some more water based plants would be nice. I’d love the ability to put a little pond on my forest. The app also has some integration with the Apple Watch but I’d also love something like a quick replant button on the watch that starts the same tree and timer combo again.",5,tahrao,2025-05-28 09:39:46-07:00,positive
,867374917,,Focus Keeper - Pomodoro Timer,"I have used this app for years now as a pro subscriber and it’s been great, but recent updates have caused a variety of bugs which are making it useless at the moment. First, it was slow to load, some of the UI was changed and timers started counting up instead of down, etc. 
I uninstalled and reinstalled and those issues seem to be fixed now, but others persist. Namely, notification sounds seem to only work half the time at most, and I get banner notifications that seem to have no connection to my use of the app. For instance I last used the app this morning and closed it out afterwards, but all day today I keep getting notifications saying “your focus session ended!” or “short break has ended, get back to work!” and is showing I’m on session 31 out of 12, so it must be counting and logging sessions even though the app is closed. The same thing happened yesterday.

It’s only going to block it if u type in violence which normal people do not do. 

If you want to see let’s say a scene from an R rated war movie you are not going to type in violence. So do not use if your purpose is to make sure your children do not watch gore it won’t work.

If they finish the task before it shuts down, you simply cancel the shut down.  Bed time schedules make the kids associate shut down with time not you.

The rep keeps texting me steps to perform from a list they have - instead of determining which steps I've already completed and then pickup from there. 

They are totally UNABLE to assist me or resolve my issue because they will only provide support via text and this requires a call - a likely 5-min call.

,917701230,,Influenster: Try & Review,"I used to enjoy this app a lot before a lot of the changes have been made, which I feel was unwarranted for. I used to love see the badges for products I reviewed - now that’s gone. Right now, they focus on claim nows mostly, and while I’ve been able to snag some, I feel that they keep offering me things that don’t align with my interests. I’ve been working hard in putting out authentic reviews and reviewing things I’ve personally purchased and it’s not helping with anything any more. 

Like some others have said - if you don’t fit into their mold, you won’t get anything. They’re extremely biased in who they give things to, and I’ve noticed if you’re a POC, you won’t get as much offers as opposed to if you were white. I usually see on Reddit and Instagram of people who get multiple claims daily or weekly, and its always a very similar group of people. What’s worse is that sometimes they give reviews like “I can’t wait to try this!” like hello? You were sent the product to test it? Some of these reviews come off really fake. But who cares if Influenster doesn’t care, am I right?

I never get notifications for claim now nor does the app bother to offer me anything new. I also see some people getting really big ticket items and always wondered if I would get a chance. I have been on the app for over 3 years now, and I’m in mid to late 20s, so I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’ve settled that Influenster would never offer me these things given my demographics, and have put less effort into this app compared to what I’ve done in the past. 

I’ve also seen some disturbing posts of people selling ozempic through comments and the fact Influenster is doing nothing to remove these accounts gets concerning.

,930904592,,Sattva Meditations & Mantras,This is the best meditation app out there and I have tried more than a few. The Apple Watch app is very simple however it doesn't always register your meditation right away and if you make an achievement it doesn't register with the watch. It takes a few days to pop up. I'd love to see them use the heart rate monitor from the watch in an update. If you are new there are guided meditations.  If you're a regular meditator you can go it on your own or set a timer to end your session. I love the social aspect of it. It is very encouraging to interact with others working towards freedom. I like the different badges you get for different things. Kind of Pavlovian but it works. Challenge yourself to free your mind. Meditate with others. Check out the score board. It's not a race but it sure is inspiring. Beautiful app simple interface.,5,Rockherchick,2016-01-05 20:11:49-07:00,positive

,930904592,,Sattva Meditations & Mantras,"This app has a number of good things going for it. It has a clean look and interface, the dashboard and tracking is very useful, and it doesn’t feel as gimmicky as other platforms. However, there are some simple key features missing. First, the heart rate tracking is either too difficult to use or just doesn’t work. Given the number of heart rate trackers on the market now, heart rate data via a smartwatch or other device is way overdue. Second, the timer feature only lets you use either their preselected sounds (which interrupt your meditation by cutting in and out to buffer) and your music library. For those who use Spotify, you are out of luck. Third, also in the timer feature, when the timer ends, the sound abruptly cuts out. It is very jarring to go from your relaxing meditative sound to an abrupt silence. Even if you use a bell to mark the end of the mediation, the ending is abrupt and disturbs some of the mindfulness you were just building. Simply allowing the sounds to continue after the bell (even at a reduced volume) would greatly improve the experience. Overall, good app, but needs improvements before it can be considered the best choice.",4,Ryan Reviwer,2019-01-02 13:37:19-07:00,neutral

,953426154,,Be Focused Pro - Focus Timer,"I love this app, I use it daily! Time management is my Achilles heel, so being able to visually see the time winding down has been really nice.

It’s really nice because I don’t have to be using my phone to still get the time-minding reminders I need. Finally this app has been a game changer for me with intimidating tasks. Setting a timer has been a great way for me to break through that initial anxiety and just get started. Breaking down tasks into manageable parts with this app has helped me be both more efficient and effective, so I would suggest it to anyone who could use some help with time management!

,954029412,,Parental Control App - OurPact,"…but it just didn’t do what I needed it to do. I wanted to give my son an hour of screen time each day, and I wanted it automated through OurPact so I didn’t have to be the bad guy and on top of it constantly. Specifically, wanted him to be able to listen to an hour of music or podcasts. Unfortunately, OurPact’s shut-off mechanism doesn’t work for audio: if a user turns on music with their time allotment, but turns off the screen, the time they spend listening doesn’t count against the allowance. After just a couple days I realized my son was on his headphones longer than an hour (and he sure wasn’t going to point it out to me!). I got in touch with the company to ask for help, and this was their response:

“This particular issue is a bit of a challenge for us since it's related to Apple product functionality and how iOS devices report applications to our software. We hope to have a fix for this in a future update... 
 
In the meantime, we suggest you send a manual 'Grant' to your child's device, then after a few minutes send a manual 'Block'. 
 
This should shut them out of Spotify or whatever app they were trying to access. They may try again, but from our experience, usually, they give up pretty quickly and decide just to call it quits.”

I had suspected it was an Apple thing, not an Out Pact thing, but I had hope. Here’s how I responded:

“In response to your suggestion: ""we suggest you send a manual 'Grant' to your child's device, then after a few minutes send a manual 'Block'."" This is exactly why we got OurPact in the first place: to do away with the need for ""granting"" anything. As a parent trying to keep my kids safe online, I am making myself insane trying to give my kids an hour of screen time *OR* listening time each day. When it is me who is getting asked for time, and me who is setting a timer for an hour, and me who is disabling the kids' devices when an hour is up, I take on a part-time job as a police officer. I don't know about you, but as a parent I have to be the bad guy plenty enough already. If, on the other hand, the device was set up automatically to give an hour of screen/listening time when the child wants it, to count down and shut off automatically, it would offer me peace of mind *AND* not require my engagement. Win-win! 

So....if that's not something OurPact can do, then I'd like my money back. Because that's definitely how you promoted it.”

After that, I’ve pinged OurPact twice but they haven’t responded, and I haven’t received a refund. I’m especially unhappy about this because setting the app up on my son’s phone was outrageously invasive and time-consuming. 

I don’t know that there’s any real solution to this problem out there yet. Not OurPact’s fault, but they need to be clear on the limitations in their advertising.",2,JCL in SLO,2024-11-08 08:14:59-07:00,negative

So then I gave up on the schedules and just turned off apps manually every time we needed to. We haven’t used it for a while because he’s gotten older, just have it in case he gets in trouble or on restriction and we need to turn his apps off. I realized he has snap chat and TikTok now because he has emails from them, yet those apps aren’t even listed on his apps on OurPact? OurPact should have notified me when he downloaded these apps. Didn’t.  So we took his phone, deleted his account and just re synced it, thinking maybe we just needed to start over. All of his apps are listed now. So that’s great. But they should have always been listed. That was two days ago. I’m looking at OurPact again today, and for some reason there’s no TikTok! So I have to go in manually and shut off his apps, which I shouldn’t have to do anyways if the schedules would work correctly, and I can’t even shut off TikTok.

The first is the up next feature on Apple Watch complications, which tends to be behave a little flaky. 

The other is that it’s limited to 24 habits. I wrote to the developer quite some time ago, and they said that they were working on that. However, nothing has happened.

I made major changes to my habits—changing some existing ones and added new ones on my phone—this morning. I hadn't used my MacBook in a few days, and after using it I realized that instead of syncing all of my latest changes from my phone to my MBP, Streaks did the opposite and replaced all the work I'd done today with the days-old versions from my Mac.

1) Setting up notifications is difficult and requires a separate step outside of setting up the task. The notifications should be able to be set up per sub task. It would be better if you could edit a task and set a notification time for each sub task. 
2) Notifications are not reliable on Apple Watch. I only get a 2 notifications per day on a task with 5 sub tasks. 
3) If I complete all sub tasks early in the day, I still get notifications later in the day. Having the ability to add a notification time per sub task might help solve this as the notifications would not be completely separate from the tasks themselves.

,973421278,,MultiTimer: Multiple timers,"I tried several other timer apps only to be left disappointed. This app however, I paid for the pro version because I believe this app is very promising and the best experience I’ve had so far.

What I love so far from this app: 
1. love that I can set the “ALERT auto repeat” to constantly repeat itself. This is helpful in times when I have to setup away from my phones and alarm goes off repeatedly and when I get back I am reminded that time’s up. Unlike another timer I downloaded prior to this, it only ring once and if I am away from my phone then I just missed the reminder and lose track of time as that timer then goes into another continuous loop.
2. Love that I can set the “TIMER” to auto repeat. Ie. I set my reminder to drink my water every hour without having to reset or do anything!
3. Love the user interface and the ability to see everything all on one screen without having to scroll through to find what I want. It’s like the screen adjust itself to accommodate for all my different timers I keep adding - all on one screen! 
4. love the ability to have different timers running at different intervals. Ie. If I am working on something that should take 1 hour, but need to break it down then I can set different timers for that and run it all at the same time (Ie. 5 min, 15 min, 7 min, etc…) 

What I would love to see:
1. The ability for the app to act like an alarm even if the phone volume is turned off. I don’t always like to have my phone on for a reason or sometimes forget to turn my phone volume back on in the morning, but then I would miss the reminders on this app. Of course there would need to be a way for people to turn on/off this function because it may not work for everyone. 
2. Wish that there’s a way to still see the timer from my phone while the screen is turned off. 
3. Ringer does not work when using EarPods.

My only real issue is the Watch app, it hides all boards with containers in them and I wasn't informed of this shortcoming until I deduced why some of my boards were not appearing. The lack of unique notification sound for watchOS notifications also makes it easy to mistake for the notifications of other apps (like, say, an annoying Discord user using the @everyone ping) and thus ignore by mistake. So I end up just not bothering with the Watch app and just stick to having this app's notifications ring on my phone.

I also love that I can then take this data and export it as a CSV file.

Improvements:

Currently, the stopwatch starts when you press a button. Then it pauses if you hit it again. Finally, it resets the third time you hit the button
Personally, I wish there was an option to customize this sequence. I wish I could just hit the button to start, and hit it a 2nd time to reset it. I don’t really care what time it measures because I’ll be analyzing it later.

And because I also monitored patients being treated using a different treatment modality (Spravato) on other days, I had additional timers - which utilized different colors and icons - for monitoring those patients. Healthcare Technicians would sometimes had 8 handheld timers with sticky notes on a desk.

Additionally, you can keep a list of your tasks needed to be done, check them off and view a history of the tasks and sessions you’ve completed.

As watchOS 6 is not yet available for Series 1 & 2 watches, I’m unable to download and use it with my watch. Disappointing. While it’s important for developers to keep up to date with OS updates, and I would otherwise appreciate the timeliness, there’s no reason to drop support for a previous version of an OS when it’s not yet available for all devices that will support it. Glad I have not yet paid for this app. I don’t mind the subscription fee, as I understand the work involved in app maintenance and development, but I would have been livid if I’d been a paying subscriber and support for my watch was dropped before the watchOS update became available for me.

,983826477,,Productive - Habit Tracker,"I think there should be a feature where you can mark that a habit was not completed. There is a feature where you can skip a habit in special occasions, and there is a feature where you can mark that a habit was completed. I understand that if you don’t do either of these then the app recognizes it as an incomplete habit but sometimes when I go back to previous days and see that a habit is not completed, I can’t remember if I just forgot to mark it as complete or if I actually didn’t do it. That’s why I really think there should be a feature to mark that a habit was not completed instead of just having that be recognized by the app if you don’t mark it at all. I don’t want to just skip a habit and have it say that my streak continues. I benefit from the punishment of losing a streak. That’s why I want there to be an additional feature to mark that a habit was not completed. Maybe it could be a long press on the habit or some other type of gesture. 

Thank you for your time and for considering this feature. Other than this feature, I would actually give five stars—but this is a huge issue for me that is make or break for me.",2,Dañiel Aügust,2024-02-16 20:54:36-07:00,negative

,992210239,,Happier Meditation,"This app started out great. I still use it every day and have for years, but I really thought about not renewing this February when my annual subscription came due. But I saw that it had rebranded as “Happier“ so I decided to give it a chance. 

I didn’t realize that founder and creative force Dan Harris left over creative differences. I don’t know if that’s why I dislike the new stuff on the app so much, but it doesn’t seem to actually understand mindfulness anymore. And some of the content is squishy and would never have been allowed by Dan. There are these video shorts of people getting interrupted in their daily life and then explaining how they try to be mindful in that moment, and they just don’t work.

I miss Dan’s podcast episodes. I found the new video course almost unwatchable. Because I’ve still got nine more months., I will keep an eye on the app to see if it improves. But I suspect I will be sticking with the Waking Up app and the Plum Village app and dumping this one. There doesn’t seem to be a vision anymore.

Thanks,

,992210239,,Happier Meditation,"A key tenet of Buddhism is learning to sit with things that are unpleasant and let them go. That is now my experience with this app. Gone is the serendipity of finding a daily meditation that you didn’t know was exactly what you needed. Instead I get an AI curated list of meditations like “dealing with rage” and “a depressed day”. Those are not issues I’m dealing with so if they had come up as generic options for everyone I would have just moved along. But now those are the options chosen FOR ME specifically. I realize it’s just a machine and not a person accusing me of rage issues, but it still is unpleasant. Maybe they’re trying to give me rage issues!! :) It used to be nice to read the weekly wisdom. That is gone. The fact that the developer says it’s available on the website is useless to me when I’m meditating on my phone. It does feel like the whole thing has moved from being something health promoting for people to something designed for data collecting and optimizing corporate profits.

,992210239,,Happier Meditation,"I used to like this app a lot - open it up and it offered a ten-minute meditation for the day. I liked that I didn’t have to choose something, I could just go with the default. After a couple of years it seemed like there weren’t many new meditations though, and now, recent updates have changed the app considerably, where I can’t even get to the meditations until after “checking in” about my goals for the month, and there’s so way to skip that and just go to the meditations.

Checking in is a fine thing to offer for people who want that, but why make it mandatory for all users? Anyway, I won’t be renewing my subscription anymore after it runs out next time. $99 a year is a lot when the app doesn’t even function the way I would like it to anymore.",2,etakytak,2024-09-03 10:30:02-07:00,negative

It became a daily practice for her and for her husband who, I was told, said, “I wish I’d found this twenty years ago.” 
I have meditated for many years, but Dan’s app has been a perfect support for my practice. He seems to have found the sweet spot, something for everyone. The interviews alone are life changing. I am so grateful to Dan and the Ten Percent team.

,992210239,,Happier Meditation,"I unsubscribed after 5 years due to the new “check in” landing page. I have paid the 100 bucks a year for 5 years. The content IS high quality.  Now, when you open the app, the landing page is an interactive “check in.”  I have an extra click to get to a meditation. 
It would be great if they had a “lifetime membership” price. After having paid $500 for the services of this app—it was worth it. I kinda wish it was paid for and I could just ride out this annoyance until they fix it.  But—It is too expensive to be broken/annoying.  
Every year, I decided—“I get a lot out of this app, I will buy it again.”  But the landing page is a deal breaker.  If I were able to keep the whole app—for free—for what I have already paid, I would. But I cannot emphasize enough how much I hate the “check in” as the landing page.  I tried checking in—ughhh. If they want to offer a check-in section of the app—great! Offer check in. Offer journaling prompts. Offer habit checkers.

First and foremost prerequisite to be costly. While everything becomes itemised, the digital landscape is loud, over complicated, and unfamiliar. This app has given me the visual silence, the mental shelter for one’s sovereignty with one’s UX interface. It provided me the comfort to facilitate the very arduous bureaucratic red tape that limits and restricts our lives. I find myself ignoring most of the apps I use as my body learns to recognise them as piercing alarms of disparity. I like the soft features that feels “safe” to create- as it prioritises the functions, making the experience not a task, a chore, or a system to be coded, eroded, followed, or enslaved to. It is absent of useless defiances such as limitations on control, littered with ads or corners that jab sharply at the experience to just…execute. This app is order in the chaos.

,993066159,,To Do List MinimaList & Widget,"It would be nice if the widget could be set to dark mode. *Update* I got a response saying that I could set the widget to dark mode if I went to “Settings” and then “Widget Settings.” Of course, that is where I had gone the first time I tried to do this so I was skeptical. It turns out I was wrong. You CAN set the widget to dark mode in Settings but it is a bit complicated. On the “HomeScreen” page, you have to click on whichever list you want to use (or are already using) for your widget - Small List, Today, Medium List, or Large List. When you click on the list you’ve chosen, a new screen with Options pops up. From the first page of the Options menu, you need to hit “Next” to get to the page where you can change the setting to Dark Mode, although make sure that you have a Source List selected otherwise you won’t be able to move forward to the next screen. On the next screen, there are 3 different ways to set the widget to dark mode. You can toggle the “Auto Dark Mode” button, select“Dark Mode Setting” or select any color for the background and text. Maybe my review should have said, “It would be nice if setting the widget to dark mode were simpler or if could be done from the iPhone Home screen.” If I had gone through the app to add the widget to my Home screen, I might have seen this option at the beginning but since I added the app directly from my Home screen, I didn’t encounter these options in the process of setting it up.

It has helped me get some sort of routine and get through tasks, but there are some glitches. You lose connection a lot or sessions end. And it’s impossible to get all the check-ins.

I have yet to connect with friends so maybe when I do it will serve as a stronger incentive to stay motivated and get things done. However if there was one thing I can add to this it would be a sort of calendar and or tracking device atleast to see what you have done so far in your past days. For example if I have a habits list that I want to complete for the day I want to be able to look back and see my progression from getting only some done to getting all of them done consistently. I think it would help to see what I have accomplished so far and same things with the habits section so I can see what days I was working more on developing habits and or doing the habits I am not fond of.,4,nabilkhsveinr,2022-01-21 23:15:42-07:00,positive

I created my account (@DotC_WC) on the Fourth Of July. The first thing that drew me in? The community!! I fell in love with the guild/tavern features! They helped me find some great people that shared my interests! 

Fast forward to August First. I open the app, having already finished my dailies, go into the Cat Lovers guild, and you know what I saw?
THAT THE TAVERN AND GUILDS WERE GOING TO BE REMOVED. It made me feel sick with anxiety.

,994882113,,Habitica: Gamified Taskmanager,"Excellent app, I enjoy using it all the time. It color codes your habits and daily tasks to let you know which are no being done. The gamification is a unique feature but it lacks incentives to want you to complete your habits. If there were benefits of having certain pets and mounts it would have been cool. Also there is a lack of quests and rewards. 

The biggest issue for me is the speed of the app, so many times I will complete a task it will lag and not complete. Even after refreshing it and closing the app, it only after a while the app will finally accept the input. The same goes for quest completion and starting, it’s super slow, not sure why that is but it’s super annoying.

There are so many different things you can do to customize this to fit your schedule and your needs you can make one for Budget. You can make one for Goals or Projects. The only thing negative is that it’s a little messy and difficult to navigate; or I would’ve given it five stars.

I like that as I improve (example write recap email daily) the color goes up. If I start skipping or slacking in this area of work/life it goes red. This has helped me improve areas of my work, keeping my from having hard conversations later. I would like to see an Apple Watch app added would be nice.

,997102246,,Spark AI Email & Calendar,I’ve been trying different email providers and this is by far the best. Actually makes it possible to keep up with all those emails and keep box clean. Search function works great.,4,ThorThena,2025-03-30 06:23:59-07:00,positive
,997102246,,Spark AI Email & Calendar,You still can’t send any email from the app. What a useless app that this is to use.  I wouldn’t recommend this app if you want to use an email app then look elsewhere because this isn’t it.,1,Fredreed,2025-07-17 09:20:19-07:00,negative
