It started with the alarm going off randomly with no way to turn it off. That happens several times a week and the phone needs restarted to get it to stop. Then it started freezing up and needing to be restarted several times a day. Now it's going crazy with notifications and I have to block them. For example I got 46 notifications in a quick row that it was time to start my morning routine today.,3,,2025-08-13 00:50:00,negative

But I try to set up playlist to play throughout the night and the editing is terrible. How to rearrange playlist functionality barely works: you can't really create something up to the top of the playlist - It just goes back to position three or four. And really hard to save changes because the save button gets hidden. I am using a pixel 7 -- very surprising that developers haven't addressed this.

I've been making a lot of changes in my life and giving meditation a try was one of them. The other Christian meditation apps that I tried were terrible and locked most of their features until you paid a sky high subscription price. This app is AMAZING. Anytime I've tried meditation before I've hated it and this lady's voice is AWESOME and calming and easy to follow. I will DEFINITELY be subscribing.

Was pleasantly surprised to see that we can unlock a new room now! I just have one suggestion, perhaps the ""focus"" planter button could be made a bit smaller and moved a bit up so that it's not too near the mobile's home button please? I keep accidentally clicking on focus when I mean to exit the app as the alignment of the device and app buttons is as such. For your consideration! Thank you",5,,2025-09-19 11:29:00,positive
