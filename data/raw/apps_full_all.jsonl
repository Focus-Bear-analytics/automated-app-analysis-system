FASTER RESULTS- Your past experiences don't matter. Even if you're brand new to this, you'll still see progress in just 8 minutes.- You don't need to focus hard on your breathing or be in a certain pose. All you need is to sit down, close your eyes, plug in your earphones, and start listening. We'll take care of the rest.HYPNOTELLING: OUR SECRET WEAPONWe like to believe we make all our decisions rationally, but that's not exactly true. Most of the time, we're driven by emotions we don't fully understand or can't entirely control.Luckily, your subconscious mind can give you all the things you need. You just need to speak its language - images, sensations etc.Your subconscious mind is like a monkey: it doesn't understand words, but it understands visual information, and remembers emotions. Once you understand this, you can tune it to your liking. Voice allows you to connect to your subconscious mind. It teaches, it heals, it helps to calm down and regain your strength.For example, it won't only help you deal with anxiety, sleep problems, or burnout, but will also help get to the root of your problems and the reason behind their symptoms, so you can feel calm, inspired, and motivated again.You become the main character of an exciting adventure story. It's sort of like embarking on a psychological quest in a dreamlike state. You move through a story, face challenges along the way, and learn how to tackle them.Unlike meditation, our stories help keep your brain alert and conscious. It enters a trance-like state where it absorbs information more effectively, giving you faster results. The closest thing it can be compared to is affirmations. You'll notice relaxation and motivation as quick as 8 minutes story.BASED ON RESEARCH-BACKED TECHNIQUESHypnotelling is based on a method that has been used for athlete training, supportive therapy, psychotherapy, and for scientific research.HYPNOTELLING EFFECTIVELY HELPS- lower anxiety and stress levels- get you to sleep faster without meditation, and improve your sleeping habits- boost your energy- increase self-motivation- improve mental healthMeditation help you develop mindfulness, but it's a slow and difficult process that can be hard to navigate on your own. Voice is like meditation 2.0: it not only allows you to expand your consciousness, but also helps you apply this experience and take action today, tomorrow, and forever. And the best thing is, you'll acquire beneficial mental skills that will stay with you for the rest of your life!EMBARK ON YOUR ADVENTURE WITH VOICE TODAYSend your suggestions and questions to help@voice-stories.appUser terms and conditions: https://voice-stories.app/#popup-terms", "release_date": "2021-10-26", "last_update": "2025-10-01", "version": "4.0.62", "requires_android": "7.0 and up", "icon_url": "https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/av6nj_oyNGELhSWdvU9Krl6y7qAy4kwDUlcqJCyA7LYm7ZADPKs2y4gX9TQK4AU05A=w240-h480-rw", "content_rating": "Everyone Learn more", "scraped_at": "2025-10-03"}

The treatment includes Focus Score, a first-of-its-kind personalized metric where you can track attention progress.EndeavorOTC is for adults 18 years and older with ADHD experiencing inattention-related challenges that affect their quality of life such as diminished focus, inability to complete projects or tasks, keep track of important items, and more. Built with the same technology as EndeavorRx, the world's first FDA-authorized video game treatment. EndeavorOTC is available now by subscription. No prescription needed. EndeavorOTC was studied in more than 220 participants over a 6-week period. In the clinical trial, 88% of participants saw improvement in their attention and 73% of participants reported quality of life improvements, including an increased ability to balance projects, get things done on time and keep track of important items like phone, wallet, and keys. There were no lasting or serious side effects in any clinical trials for EndeavorOTC. (1,2)How EndeavorOTC improves focus: The gameplay challenges you to tap targets and navigate obstacles to boost your attention and focus. As you progress through the game, the technology is continuously measuring your performance and using adaptive algorithms to adjust the difficulty and personalize the treatment experience.How to Play EndeavorOTC: Playing EndeavorOTC can fit into your daily routine. The more you play, the better your results.Playing the game every day for an initial six weeks can improve your attention and other functions that make up your ability to focus. Users will be given a target Focus Score increase which should be achievable in six weeks. Based on clinical trial data, the target increase provided directly relates to improvement in ADHD-related symptoms and overall quality of life. And, for the vast majority of people, this will leave room for continued improvement in Focus Score and cognitive abilities as well as ADHD symptom management beyond the initial six week course of treatment. It is recommended that patients speak to their health care provider before starting EndeavorOTC treatment, and before making any medical decisions. © 2025 Akili Interactive Labs, Inc.

Every family’s relationship with technology is unique, so we built tools for you to choose the right balance for your family, and help them create healthy digital habits. You can use the app to see how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings, and more.  With Family Link, you can:  Establish digital ground rules  • Set screen time limits — Find the screen time that works best for your child. Family Link lets you set daily time limits, with school time and downtime schedules for their devices, so you can help your child find a healthy balance.  • Manage your child’s apps — Give your child the flexibility they need when it comes to app usage. Set individual app time limits, and unlimited time for educational or regularly used apps. You can block apps, too.  Manage content filters and security & privacy  • Manage what they see online — Set up parental controls on Google services like Chrome, Play, YouTube, and Search. Family Link allows you to block inappropriate sites, require approval for new apps, manage permissions for apps and websites, and more.  • Secure their account — Family Link gives you access to manage your child’s account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child’s password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel necessary.*  *Children over the applicable age can manage their own account.  Stay connected on the go  • See where they are — It’s helpful to be able to find your family when they’re on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they’re carrying their device.  • Get notifications and alerts — Family Link delivers critical notifications including when your child arrives or leaves a certain location. You can also ring devices and view the device’s remaining battery life.  Important Information  • Family Link’s tools vary depending on your child’s device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/  • While Family Link helps you manage your child’s purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will apply only when your child makes a purchase through Google Play’s billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternate billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.  • You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.  • To see the location of your child or teen’s device, the device must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet through data or wifi.  • Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome, and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.  • While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the internet safe. Family Link can not determine the content on the internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device, and determine what path to online safety looks best for your family.", "release_date": "2017-03-15", "last_update": "2025-09-26", "version": "Varies with device", "requires_android": "Varies with device", "icon_url": "https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rfQsLTQvlTitGF915EPBDlCH8UsuAk649xftN-GPi_s_ORnfVLSCX9MEs1AGflbNOGo=w240-h480-rw", "content_rating": "Everyone Learn more", "scraped_at": "2025-10-03"}

Set up a habit2. Tell HabitBull how you went for a day3. Watch your daily streak increaseHabits are no more than routines which you perform subconsciously. To build one - train yourself. To break one, find another one which is similar, yet different and nicer, and repeat it until it sticks.To assist you with this HabitBull lets you set reminders for each habit and displays them on days when you need to be successful. This is especially useful if you have a to do list with repeating tasks or if you want to be reminded to do the same thing every day. It can also be used as a calendar planning tool or checklist, but also as a very effective repeating reminder (e.g. to drink water every 2 hours).HabitBull does feel a little like a game in which you compete with yourself. The task is to get a long streak for the habit you are working on by covering your goals. The longer the better. It takes a couple of months to fully build a new routine, so don't give up - it takes time and if you are consistent it will work; even if it takes a few attempts.There are many things which you may want to improve. HabitBull can be used as a planner in building habits like taking your pills regularly, exercise, or keep to a diet. It can also be used as a helper for people suffering from memory problems. As for your vices, HabitBull can be a useful goal tracking tool, or a smart notebook, to assist you while breaking bad habits like nail-biting, drinking alcohol and even improving your dating skills.It is entirely up to you, really.

Regain your freedom.Pause before opening apps or websites: Take a moment before launching a distracting app. The wait time can increase with each use, helping you build intention — a technique also seen in apps like Opal.Interrupt your scrolling: Limit your time on distracting apps to short bursts so you don’t get pulled in. If you’ve tried tools like Opal, this approach will feel familiar.Set usage goals: Define daily limits per app — and optionally block access when you hit your target.Customize by day and time: Flexible settings for different days of the week and hours of the day, tailored per app.Mindful prompts before opening apps: Messages like “Is this important?” encourage reflection — a small but powerful habit, also appreciated by users of focus-first apps like Opal.See only the screen time that matters: Track your time on distracting apps only. Productive tools like Google Maps won’t distort your stats.ScreenZen uses Accessibility permissions to block websites.", "release_date": "2023-04-07", "last_update": "2025-06-28", "version": "2.1.7", "requires_android": "7.0 and up", "icon_url": "https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vojRokYSHkjs7QdATihGzPoQYRSnpZ0vxJ2mqjY1UqpBsD9k0atYzW7LFZwAzLIkcyCV=w240-h480-rw", "content_rating": "Everyone Learn more", "scraped_at": "2025-10-03"}

This is achieved through pineal gland stimulation using brainwave entrainment music. The result of elevated consciousness is an increase in our natural extrasensory abilities. With elevated consciousness, awareness, creativity, extrasensory perception, and intuition are all increased. The third eye serves as the connection to all knowledge and endless creativity. The pineal gland is stimulated through the use of isochronic modulation which is the most advanced form of brainwave entrainment. Through brainwave entrainment, elevated states of delta, alpha, theta, beta or gamma wave are increased and the mind is placed into the proper meditative state. With daily Pinealwave meditation the third eye will be opened and consciousness will be elevated. The power and potential of meditation being used to activate the pineal gland has been known and used by many cultures throughout the history of mankind.  THE POWER OF THIRD EYE OPENINGThe concept of the third eye is a spiritual and philosophical one that is found in various cultures and belief systems around the world. It is often associated with the pineal gland, which is a small gland in the brain that is believed to regulate the body's circadian rhythms.  Here are some of the potential benefits that are associated with opening the third eye:Increased intuition: Opening the third eye is said to enhance your ability to perceive and understand subtle energies and to trust your intuition.Clarity of mind: By activating the third eye, you may experience greater mental clarity and focus, as well as an improved ability to concentrate and retain information.Spiritual insight: Third eye awakening can lead to deeper understanding of spiritual concepts and experiences, including meditation, mindfulness, and yoga.Enhanced creativity: By opening the third eye, you may experience greater inspiration and creativity, as well as an increased ability to access your imagination.Improved health: Some people believe that opening the third eye can improve physical health by regulating the body's internal rhythms and promoting overall balance and harmony.This app includes all 7 chakra meditations audio and 3 special categories;1.

When one of them is closed, the others will compensate by opening up more and this will create unbalance in your body, as well as unbalance in your spirit.How to Balance your Chakras?Each Chakra is associated with different colors and different sounds. Certain tones can tune your Chakras and allow energy to flow through them.The same can be done with certain wave frequencies. This app was devised and studied to help you tune your Chakras through meditation. Just tap once the buttons and a soft tune related to that Chakra will start. Tap again to stop it.We put a lot of passion in creating this app, so that everyone can enjoy it and use it to improve their spiritual life.For a better experience and to truly enjoy the high quality of the music, we recommend using headphones instead of speakers.*Chakra Meditation Balancing includes*- 7 HIGH QUALITY tunes, specifically created for each of the 7 most important Chakras- A detailed information page on each of the Chakras, useful to remind what energy centers of the body they influence, their location and their name.Now you can choose whether to log your timer sessions to the Health app as \"Mindful Minutes\".- The screen will change color once you select a specific Chakra, aiding you in your meditation.This 7 Chakra Meditation for Body Healing and Cleansing app will help you to perform chakra activation and manage your energy within your body.

Crown Chakra8. 7 Chakra Meditation9. Chakra Meditation Collection10. Chakra Meditation HandbookWhat are chakras?A chakra is a Sanskrit word that means wheel. In yoga and meditation, the chakras are wheels or discs located all over the body. There are seven main chakras aligned with the spine. They start from the base of the spine and move in a straight line, along the spine, through the crown. When energy flows unobstructed through these energy centers, your body, mind, and soul will appreciate the coordination and good health. Any obstruction to this flow could harm your overall well-being.How does chakra healing work?A series of major and minor energy centers - called chakras - exist in the body. The chakras are the energy centers of the physical body, where your beliefs and emotions are transformed into your state of health.What are the benefits of healing the chakra?Healing through the chakra is said to be able to cure almost any mental illness or disease. The process restores balance for each of the chakra sites, as it is believed that if the chakra has too much or too little energy, it will not function properly. The East Indian philosophy behind the healing of the chakras states that body and mind are connected and that a healthy body is a body in which the energies associated with each chakra are balanced and in harmony.Here are some reviews for Chakra Meditation Balancing:••••• This app is very beautiful and the music has so much relaxation in it.

Unlike an AI therapist, a mood tracker or a journal app, Betwixt takes you on a guided immersive adventure deep into the mysteries of your own mind. On this epic inner journey, you’ll reconnect with your wisest self and unlock a whole range of psychological powers:• Improve your emotional intelligence, self care and coping skills• Calm your nerves and soothe overwhelming feelings• Uncover new paths to self improvement, self actualization and growth• Tap into your subconscious mind through the power of story• Identify your values to increase your motivation, sense of gratitude and life purpose  • Deepen your self knowledge to help you in overcoming sadness, resentment, low self esteem, fixed mindset, negative perception, insecurities.💡 WHAT MAKES BETWIXT WORKBetwixt is a relaxing, de-stressing game that draws on decades of psychology research and therapeutic practice into how we feel, think and behave. It includes tools for emotion regulation and self reflection, journal prompts for mental health, elements of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), mindfulness approaches, Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), Jungian theory and others. Together, these methods work to improve your wellbeing, calm your mind, increase your self esteem and help you deal with challenging emotions. ◆ An immersive experienceIn Betwixt, you become the hero (or heroine) of an interactive adventure through a dreamlike world that responds to your thoughts and feelings. We’ve used immersive storytelling and sounds to create an alternative for people who find a CBT diary too dry, and struggle to engage with mindfulness, breathing or counseling apps, emotion trackers and mood journals. For neurodivergent users, Betwixt stands out among ADHD apps for adults by offering a  creative, engaging approach that removes distractions, improves your focus, motivation and mindset without creating digital addiction.◆ Evidence-basedIndependent psychology research shows that Betwixt can significantly reduce anxiety, stress and depression, with effects that can last months. For years, we’ve been working with various therapists and psychology researchers to make the science of wellbeing accessible to anyone. You can find an overview of our research studies and collaborations on our site at https://www.betwixt.life/\"Captivating.

Increasing your productivity. Improving your daily routine.That and more is what you can do with TimeTune, your schedule planner and time blocking app.👍 RECOMMENDED BY EXPERTSJessica McCabe from “How to ADHD” recommends TimeTune as an ideal tool to build solid routines and give structure to your day.😀 WHAT IS TIMETUNE?TimeTune is a schedule planner and time blocking app. Use it to organize your agenda, plan routines and increase your productivity.Do you know why some people can get plenty of things done in a single day while your time slips through your fingers?The answer is that they have a very structured distribution of time. They organize their agenda with a planner and have strong time management habits. That allows them to seize the day and complete their tasks.With TimeTune Schedule Planner you can do the same.👩‍🔧 HOW DOES IT WORK?TimeTune uses time blocks to build your agenda. Just add time blocks to your day or use time blocks to build templates that can be reused at any time, like a morning routine or a timetable.Templates allow you to plan upcoming schedules, routines, timetables or work shifts in a flash. You will enjoy an automated agenda.TimeTune Schedule Planner also shows you statistics to see where the time goes. Check them to see if your time is correctly structured and how you can improve.You can add custom reminders to your time blocks, so you don’t forget your agenda: reminders with custom vibrations, custom sounds, voice, etc (ideal if you have ADHD).With TimeTune Schedule Planner you can create a time management system as simple or as complex as you need. This daily planner will allow you to finally complete your tasks and save time.🤓 WHY DOES IT WORK?Time blocking is a scheduling method that divides your day into smaller segments of time for specific tasks. If you add statistics, you get the perfect time management system to optimize your productivity.A structured day increases focus and motivation. Time blocking on a daily planner allows you to concentrate on the task at hand and avoid distractions.As Cal Newport, author of “Deep Work” states:“Time blocking generates a massive amount of productivity. A 40-hour time-blocked work week produces the same amount of output as a 60+ hour work week without structure”It’s no wonder high achievers like Benjamin Franklin, Bill Gates and many others embraced this planning method and used a daily planner to organize their agenda in a structured way.Also, for people with ADHD, time blocking can be a crucial approach to tackle their agenda and avoid anxiety. If you have ADHD, TimeTune Schedule Planner allows you to focus on each task, improve your daily routine and see where the time actually goes.🤔 WHAT CAN I DO WITH TIMETUNE?With TimeTune Schedule Planner you can:★ Increase your focus and productivity★ Organize your agenda and reach your goals★ Improve your time management skills★ Plan your daily routine★ Set routines, timetables and work shifts★ Have a structured agenda★ Use it as your daily planner and routine planner★ Remove routine tasks from other calendars★ Analyze your time and discover time leaks★ Add custom reminders (ideal for ADHD)★ Free up time for yourself★ Organize your life with a better work/life balance★ Avoid anxiety and burnout★ Do everything in your agenda★ Do tasks in time if you have ADHD🙋 WHO IS IT FOR?If you would like to do more things with your time, TimeTune Schedule Planner is for you.Users with ADHD also tell us that TimeTune helps them a lot with their schedule and use the app as their routine manager. If you have ADHD, try TimeTune and let us know what you think.Thank you very much! 🥰", "release_date": "2014-09-30", "last_update": "2025-09-24", "version": "5.1", "requires_android": "5.1 and up", "icon_url": "https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/L3qZUcWIbdU1zlg8TO2pT4s4lKrl7YIuikaaD1pAE82iqCIlP21CAnwB8385iXGdgSw=w240-h480-rw", "content_rating": "Everyone Learn more", "scraped_at": "2025-10-03"}

Daily affirmations help rewire our brains, build self-esteem, and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.Positive affirmations help make major shifts in your mindset, and they also serve as prompts and daily reminders about what you’re truly capable of, ensuring every day is an amazing day.An affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your conscious and unconscious mind. The more you strengthen this connection, the more resilient you’ll be when you experience difficult or challenging circumstances.As Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe. And the best way to strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.There are many benefits to using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words, making it easier to recognize the negative and self-doubting thought patterns holding you back.- Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want, like achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting, and good, you’re creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen.- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on its head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.*It works on Wear OS: you can use it on your watch.", "release_date": "2016-02-23", "last_update": "2025-10-02", "version": "Varies with device", "requires_android": "Varies with device", "icon_url": "https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/M64ObTzs5jhpKn3s-3X-5PrW1d4htcIVY7aUKh9pdN_GOymdhpUmr1erSbO-iGW0Mj55=w240-h480-rw", "content_rating": "Everyone Learn more", "scraped_at": "2025-10-03"}

The early church continued this practice, uniting not simply around a weekly meeting but also around a daily rhythm of prayer. This practice  of returning to God over and over again throughout the day helped to launch the church all over the world. With Lectio 365, you become part of reviving this ancient rhythm of prayer in the modern church.  EXPERIENCE GOD’S PRESENCE Time each day to remember who you really are, who God really is, and the story you are living in.

This technology can be called a \"Calendar clock\".HOW IT LOOKSThe list of your calendar events is projected in the form of a pie chart in the application and on the home screen widget.Events are sectors, the beginning and duration of which you can clearly track using special arcs to follow your plan.A calendar and analog clock combined gives you an amazingly visual representation of your work, allowing you to effectively plan and calculate your day.WHAT CAN THE APPLICATION BE USED FOR?✔ Daily scheduling and visual timing.

The temptation of opening a new browser tab to find a new distraction is strong and the action is often compulsive. We all have specific sites that are our go-to distractions, but we also know that anything we click has the potential to become a distraction. except for the tools we’re using to get our work or studying done. THE ANSWER Focus by Freedom blocks only those distracting websites so that you can focus on your work or studies. You tell Focus what sites you do need for work or schoolwork, and it will block everything else. You’ll stay focused and on-task, while doing high quality work because of your sustained attention. What’s more, you’ll find you can get more done in less time without those constant online interruptions! HOW IT WORKS Focus by Freedom blocks websites by placing them behind a PIN.

Let the Productivity Owl guide you to accomplishment.*** WARNING: This extension is very annoying. The owl is flying across your pages, annoying you, criticizing you, giving you psychological exercises, and closing your tabs. If you are not serious about being productive, this extension may not be for you.*** August 2025 - Upgraded to Manifest Version 3.0 ================================================================= Do you need a new boss when working from home? Meet the Productivity Owl. The owl is very strict. He will berate and mock you. You'll be forced to complete tasks to earn break time. If you do consistent work, use the timeboxing scheduler for work/vacation, and complete the owl's psychological exercises then you might be able to earn the owl's respect. Just like the first version, the owl has 3 types of websites: Allowed, Blocked and Countdown. If a website is not on the allowed/blocked lists, you'll get a certain amount of time to get the information you need before the owl closes the tab. You can still use the scheduler to schedule free-time, and now you can also schedule work time. Version 2.0 introduced a task manager, and you get rewarded break minutes for each task you complete. There are also psychological interventions and browsing statistics in this version. Although it is technically possible to earn the owl's respect - it's highly unlikely. The owl is very judgmental.

Why it’s better: • Automatic countdown from your Calendar – join a Meet, and the Google Meet countdown timer starts with the correct duration. • Mini SubTimer (new) – time tasks, speaking turns, or agenda points without touching the main timer. • Share across tabs – show the timer on every tab so it appears on your shared screen. • Stay on track – halftime/overtime color cues, optional sound alerts, and overlap warnings. • Drag & drop – place the timer where you want; we remember the position. • Quick access to upcoming events – open the extension popup to see and join your next meetings. Two ways to use it: • Automatic: Connect Google Calendar once. The timer counts down for any Meet that matches your event. • Manual: Set a duration yourself. Great when there’s no calendar event, or an event couldn't be matched. Core features: • 🕒 Automatic Timer (Calendar matched) • ⏰ Manual Timer (set duration, see progress/halftime/over­time) •➕ Mini SubTimer for topics, Q&A, exercises • 🤝 Shareable timer (visible while screen sharing) • 🎛️ Drag & drop + saved position • 🌈 Progress, halftime & overtime color states • 🚨 Overlap alerts for back-to-back meetings • 🔊 Sound alerts (optional; configurable volume) • 📍 Favicon badge before a meeting starts • 📅 Upcoming events list in the popup (join/copy link; accept/decline invites) How it works: 1. Install the extension. 2. (Optional) Connect Google Calendar. 3. Join a Google Meet. The meeting timer overlay appears automatically. 4. Click the SubTimer icon to add a mini countdown for agenda items or controlling speaking time. 5. Click Share to mirror timers across tabs so they appear on your shared screen. Settings: • Open settings from the gear icon on the timer. Requirements & notes: • Works best in Google Chrome. • Authorization may not work in some Chromium browsers (e.g., Brave, Arc).

This extension aims to help solve that issue by putting a white or black border around the focused element, depending on whichever results in a higher contrast. Focus Indicator uses multiple strategies to aim for it to work effectively across all websites, but it can't account for every improper accessibility setup. For example, if a site has a focusable element out of the screen's bounds, it won't show any difference. It also doesn't affect which elements are able to be focused with the keyboard. It prioritizes function over form. If you'd like, you can disable the extension on certain sites (blacklist them) or you can enable the extension only on certain sites (whitelist them). All settings can be configured by clicking on the extension's icon. There are two focus indication methods, depending on your preference: 1. Overlay (default, new with version 2) - Works by having a floating outline above the current focused element's position - Almost guaranteed to show the outline if it is possible to, EVEN IF the focused element is behind another element 2. On Element - Works by modifying the current element's focused styles - The indicator will sometimes end up partly or fully covered up by other elements, but it can be less intrusive Overlay Mode settings: - Indicator color mode - Solid (default) - The outline will be either solid black or solid white - Hybrid - The outline will be a black and white inversion of whatever is directly behind each individual portion of it - Outline width (default: 4px) - Adjust the thickness of the outline - Outline offset (default: 1px) - Set how much space there is between the element and the outline - Use transition between focused elements (default: off) - Animates focus shifts for better visual tracking - Use \"On Element\" mode for text input elements (default: on) - The overlay may cover text while typing in certain text input elements, mainly in online code editors, so \"On Element\" mode can be used for just those elements insteadSee less", "release_date": null, "last_update": "Flag concern", "version": "UpdatedMarch 6, 2025", "icon_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DMDvRjFQzgh7IGwjQNST5tJAs_gRC5p6x5HqGILjlLvPmS6l_ktgPHcZ862-7fs8O6GKg--_XEScnDptXoRFVbKW=s128-rj-sc0x00ffffff", "scraped_at": "2025-10-03"}

Custom blocklist and password protection. Stay focused, and block distractions.If you want some time to browse online but hope to avoid a full-blown internet spiral, a site blocker might be perfect for you. Set a time limit for distracting sites. When you reach the limit, a block goes into place. That means you still get to check your feed now and then, just not for too long or too often. Site blocker is designed to help you stay focused on studying, learning, and working. Blocks all time-westing websites to keep you productive and away from all the distractions the internet offers. To use a site blocker, set a password, decide which websites you want access to, and let the site blocker block the rest. If you want to visit a site you have blocked, enter your password, and decide how long you want to be on the blocked site. If you’re a parent, you can set the password for your child. Or, if you’d like to use it yourself, have a friend or partner put it for you to help you concentrate. And voila! You now have a set of internet guardrails that help to help you stay productive and on task whether you’re studying, remote learning, or need an extra boost of self-control to finish a project. ⭐️Features⭐️ 👉 Block sites, including its subdomains Remove all distracting and harmful websites from your life by blocking them for you while you need to stay focused and productive. 👉 Allowlist Add exceptions to the blocked websites list. Sites from this list avoid all blocking settings. 👉 Focus mode The focus mode timer lets you control your schedule via the Pomodoro technique. Break down your tasks into intervals followed by a short break. With ‘Focus Mode,’ you can set times to disable websites and browse freely. 👉 Time management Show how many work cycles you completed during a session. So you’ll be able to get all your tasks done and still have time to browse your favourite sites and apps in between. 👉 Password protection If you start focus mode, you can stop it with a passcode of your choosing, making it harder to procrastinate. You can also password-protect the options page to keep you from efficiently removing sites from your list. 👉 Unstoppable focus mode Select the option to hide the pause and stop buttons in the extension settings. And you won't be able to stop blocking sites until the block time expires. 👉 Funny blocked page You will now see funny images if you are trying to enter a blocked site. To do this, you need to enable this option in the site blocking settings. You will still not be able to enter the blocked site, but perhaps a funny picture will make you smile :)) Block Site is one of the best productivity tools available to help people procrastinate less, become more productive and reach their life goals.

Whenever you want to make progress towards your goals, plant a seed in Flora. As you work hard, the seed will grow into a healthy tree. Let the tree be your coach and grow yourself with it. You will be amazed by how great you can be.\n\nFOCUS TREES\n\nHave trouble putting down the phone? Flora blocks distracting apps in a pleasant way to help you focus on what’s more important in real life. If you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app while growing a tree, the tree will be killed! But if succeeding, you'll unlock new trees.\n\nDOUBLE EFFICIENCY WITH FRIENDS \n\nThings get even more interesting when you challenge your friends to plant trees together—you will see who kills a tree (ouch). However, if you successfully stay away from your phones together, each of you will win an additional tree from a random friend. You can also chat and share your progress to motivate each other and keep everyone on track.*\n\n* Flora is the original app for multi-user tree planting and delivers the best features that help you and your friends be productive. \n\nTO-DO LIST & WIDGET\n\nFlora is a to-do list, and more. Simply create a to-do item and set a reminder, then you will never forget a thing. Even better, you can tag your trees with a to-do item to easily track the progress towards each of your life goals. No matter if your goal is daily, weekly, or monthly, Flora will help you follow it through and achieve it.\n\nHABIT TRACKER\n\nEnjoy a rewarding daily habit routine. If you grow trees regularly, you will earn yourself a beautiful, vibrant garden. Take a look at it and feel proud of yourself! Each tree records your perseverance and a step towards a healthy life. You can also view the daily, weekly, or monthly statistics of your activities in Flora to find opportunities to improve your time-management and planning skills.\n\nREAL TREES, REAL IMPACT\n\nWhy not plant REAL trees while improving yourself? Flora proudly offers the opt-in Price and Care services that let you plant real trees on the earth if you kill or successfully grow a tree in the app. We partner with tree-planting organizations in Africa and East Asia, such as the Trees.org and Eden Reforestation Projects, to plant fast-growing soil rebuilding trees, fruit trees that diversify incomes and nutrition, and trees that can provide forage and fuel-wood. All these trees help make the earth greener and provide long-term financial aid to families who need it most.\n\nSounds good?

As aviation enthusiasts, we knew there was something powerful in the metaphor of flight: the clarity of a journey, the excitement of the destination, and the uninterrupted time between.

Initially, you're full of enthusiasm, but soon, your passion wanes. Memorizing words becomes a chore, the instrument is neglected, workouts turn into a burden, and progress in the new language stalls...\nYou start doubting yourself: “Maybe I just don’t have what it takes to stick with long-term commitments.”\n\nThat’s not true! Let us explain the real reasons.\n\n● Lack of Immediate Rewards:\nYou understand the long-term value of these tasks, but how much does this half-hour of focus matter right now?\n\n● Repetition Leads to Boredom:\nWhen the initial novelty wears off, the repetitive nature of the task can make you feel bored and tired.\n\n● Overly Negative Focus: \nFocusing on what you haven't accomplished rather than acknowledging what you have done can lead to negative self-evaluation and loss of motivation.\n\nLet Exocus Help You!\n\n\n====== Exocus Solutions ======\n\nExocus is a gamified focus timer that visualizes your concentration as a planet's evolution, helping you achieve long-term, pain-free focus.\n\n● Emotional Design and Sense of Meaning\nAfter each focus session, you’ll see the story of what happened to your planet during that time. Even five minutes of focus equals 38.53 million years of evolution for your planet, so your focus is crucial. Want to raise the stakes? You can enable “Hardcore Mode,” where failing to focus might cause your planet to be destroyed!\n\n● Stage-Based Incentives\nShort-term Incentives: After each focus session, the planet’s landscape changes and tells you its story.\nMedium-term Incentives: After several hours of focus, the planet undergoes more significant transformations, like forming magma, oceans, and land.\nLong-term Incentives: After around ten hours of focus, the planet completes its evolution. You can then add it to your star system, with each project corresponding to a star system, showcasing your long-term accumulation in that project.\n\n● Continuous Freshness\nWe offer hundreds of unique planet designs, satisfying your curiosity and desire to collect with constant surprises. See a planet's full appearance only after evolving it through focused efforts. Earn Stardust coins by focusing to unlock new planet seeds, motivating continuous concentration.\n\n\n====== What Makes Exocus Special? ======\n\n● Meticulously Crafted Design\nExocus uses a unique pixel art style, maintaining simplicity while incorporating delightful little Easter eggs for you to discover. We believe the beauty of Exocus can bring joy, which will ultimately translate into more focused time.\n\n● Fun Game Elements\nExocus embraces gamified design in a bold yet restrained and professional manner. We hope the game elements help you enjoy focusing, and we also care deeply about your ability to truly focus. We’ve eliminated anything that could distract you because we genuinely want to focus on achieving long-term goals with you.\n\n● Flexible Focus Modes\nExocus supports countdown timers, stopwatch mode, and the Pomodoro technique. In the Pomodoro technique, you can flexibly set focus and break durations and specify longer breaks after several focus cycles.\n\n● Convenient Project Management\nEach project corresponds to a planet. You can track different categories of focus time with projects and quickly switch between projects on the home screen by swiping left or right.\n\n● Personalized Statistics\nBased on your focus data, we provide personalized charts to help you understand your focus patterns and stay motivated to maintain consistent focus.\n\n\nTerms of Use: https://byland.work/exocus/terms.html\nSupport: exocus@byland.work\nXiaohongshu and Douyin: @异星专注的老夫妻", "release_date": "2024-04-11", "last_update": "2025-09-29", "version": "1.3.0", "icon_url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/d9/b2/a2/d9b2a234-d7e1-d536-8e5f-2538870a889f/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-11-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg", "scraped_at": "2025-10-03", "iap_count": 0, "iap_min": null, "iap_max": null}

And it did not work, because you fall back into your habits immediately? \n\nWell here is the solution:\n\none sec solves our unhealthy phone relationship at its roots: by making distracting apps less appealing, our brains lose interest to open them all the time without proper intention.\n\nThe effectiveness of one sec has been confirmed in a peer-reviewed scientific study with the Max-Planck Institute and Heidelberg University: app usage drops by 57% on average! Long-term!\n\nFight the social media algorithms and win back control over your phone usage & your subconsciousness!\n\n“one sec” uses Shortcuts Automation to toggle a deep breath animation whenever you open one of the configured apps (Instagram, Twitter, YouTube…). This breaks unconcious social media habits short-term (literally, as soon as you have set it up) and even helps long-term by adding more friction when opening these apps.\n\nDid you really want to open Instagram? Or was it just because you're bored waiting for your bus?\nThis app helps you to reflect your actions, thoughts, and feelings; disrupting harmful social media habits with mindfulness.\n\nOn top of that, “one sec” also contributes your mindful moments to the Health App via HealthKit.\n\nEspecially for people with ADHD one sec is a great tool to gain back control for incredible focus and concentration.\n\nIntegrations and collabs:\n- You can set up one sec to sync tasks with Structured, so you won't be able to access social media apps during ongoing unfinished tasks.\n- You can set up one sec to learn a new language with LENGO, so every time you open social media, you have to answer a handful of vocabularies.\n\nAvailable Subscription Options:\none sec pro (annual / monthly / lifetime unlock)\n\nTerms (EULA): https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy: https://one-sec.app/privacy/", "release_date": "2020-09-29", "last_update": "2025-09-27", "version": "5.0.4", "icon_url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/e6/9f/41/e69f4165-f8a0-efb0-f040-a2a7a1dcd7b9/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007epad-0-0-0-1-0-0-sRGB-0-85-220-0.png/512x512bb.jpg", "scraped_at": "2025-10-03", "iap_count": 0, "iap_min": null, "iap_max": null}

It helps you to form and keep track of your intentional habits, provides valuable insights for your decisions, and offers support in staying attentive.\n\n### Personal Habits\nIf you're just starting out with one or two habits or already have a long list of things you want to keep track of — HabitBoard imposes no limitations on the types of habits you can track. The Free version allows for tracking of 3 habits, Pro supports unlimited habits.\n\n### Historic Data\nIt provides a detailed calendar-like view of your historic data which grows over time. In addition, you get habit-specific statistics like current and longest streaks, completion rate, and count by week, month, and year.\n\n### Statistics\nHabitBoard provides meaningful and beautiful stats that give an overview over all your tracked habits. You can inspect your overall weekly and monthly completions, get an overall completion rate, and keep track of your daily completions. Available with HabitBoard Pro.\n\n### Weekly Goals and Skipped Days\nSome habits are not planned daily and HabitBoard makes it easy to configure automatically skipped days and weekly goals per habit. If you set a weekly goal, you'll see an additional label for the current progress in the habit list.\n\n### Notes\nYou can add notes to individual days and review them for each habit. This can come handy to, e.g., remember why you marked a day as skipped, to keep track of when you start a new book with your reading habit, or take note when you start a new progression in your exercise habit.\n\n### Customizable Colors\nEach habit can use colors according to your personal taste or for visual grouping of habits. You can customize both the colors for done and missed habit states. Available with HabitBoard Pro.\n\n### Widgets\nHabitBoard offers Lock Screen widgets, a daily completions widget, and small, medium, and a large calendar-like widgets (which are interactive on iOS 17) so that you can glance on your habits even if you're not using the app.\n\n### Shortcuts\nWith the “Mark habit as done” and “Set note for habit” Shortcuts actions, you can combine different tasks to automatically keep your HabitBoard up-to-date.\n\n### Archived Habits\nSome things also come to an end (or are paused), so HabitBoard offers a dedicated place for archived habits. Habits that live there are still fully interactive, so it can also be used as a more private area for certain habits. Available with HabitBoard Pro.\n\n### Configuration of List Labels\nStreaks are not always the most meaningful metric — sometimes it's better to focus more on completions. With HabitBoard, you can decide whether you want to display the current streak, weekly, monthly, and yearly completions in addition to the names in the habit list.\n\n### Reminders\nWhen you’re starting out, a daily reminder can be useful. If you want, the app notifies you when it’s time to review your HabitBoard for the day.\nIn addition, with HabitBoard Pro, each habit can have its own reminders. You can choose the time and weekdays where you want to be reminded, customize the notification message, and decide whether to be reminded if you already marked the habit for the day. And you can have multiple reminders per habit.\n\n### Automatic Backup and Sync\nHabitBoard securely and privately backups and syncs your habits via iCloud. If you're using a second device, your data is already there.\n\n### Support for Apple Watch\nIf you’re using an Apple Watch, you can track your daily habits from your wrist. The dedicated watch app allows for marking habits directly (which is synced with the paired iPhone) and provides various complications for your watch face to display daily progress.\n\n---\n\nIf you have feedback, a bug report, or want to be a beta tester, feel free to reach out via any of the links under *Settings → About*.\n\nThanks for using HabitBoard!\n\n---\n\nTerms of Service: https://habitboard.app/terms/\nPrivacy Policy: https://habitboard.app/privacy/", "release_date": "2022-09-12", "last_update": "2025-09-15", "version": "2.5", "icon_url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/06/7d/33/067d3333-36ee-0986-20b4-516dab6df406/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007epad-0-1-P3-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg", "scraped_at": "2025-10-03", "iap_count": 0, "iap_min": null, "iap_max": null}

You’ll also be able to see a bunch of cool statistics for each habit, such as your current and longest streak and your yearly and all-time completion rates.\n\nAny great new skill requires at least a few months of practice before you begin to see solid results: learning an instrument, getting back into shape, taking up a new language, etc. Focus on doing a little bit every day, log it in the app, and within a few months you’ll start to see incredible progress.\n\nBuild good habits, break bad habits, and achieve greatness!\n\n• Practice Better\nEvoday encourages you to practice better with its progress tracking feature. Giving up on your dreams will be harder to do when you see how long your current streaks are, and how much  practice you’ve put in so far.

To break one, find another one which is similar, yet different and nicer, and repeat it until it sticks.\n\nTo assist you with this HabitBull lets you set reminders for each habit and displays them on days when you need to be successful. This is especially useful if you have a to do list with repeating tasks or if you want to be reminded to do the same thing every day. It can also be used as a calendar planning tool or checklist, but also as a very effective repeating reminder (e.g. to drink water every 2 hours).\n\nHabitBull does feel a little like a game in which you compete with yourself. The task is to get a long streak for the habit you are working on by covering your goals. The longer the better. It takes a couple of months to fully build a new routine, so don't give up - it takes time and if you are consistent it will work; even if it takes a few attempts.\n\nYearly Subscription\n• 1 Year of premium access, first Week is completely free\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nTerms of Use: http://appforgegames.com/termsofuse.html\nPrivacy Policy: http://appforgegames.com/privacypolicy.html", "release_date": "2015-10-18", "last_update": "2024-06-28", "version": "1.4.17", "icon_url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/45/73/05/457305b1-5e3f-67eb-a800-53781687d889/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-7-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg", "scraped_at": "2025-10-03", "iap_count": 0, "iap_min": null, "iap_max": null}

Your muscles will become firmer and more toned, and you will feel stronger. Squats can even help you lose weight.\n\n• Eat healthily – everyone knows the benefits of eating healthily.

With 1Blocker, you’re safe online and nothing will distract you from enjoying sites.\n\n1Blocker is very easy to use — just flip a couple of switches to start blocking ads and trackers. The app will automatically receive cloud updates to the built-in filters silently, so you don’t need to do anything. It’s as simple as setting and forgetting.\n\n1Blocker is a fully native app designed to extend Safari naturally. It’s lightweight and doesn’t drain your battery by taking up your device’s resources.\n\nThe blocking itself is super fast because Safari does it itself. We only provide filters to Safari and don’t modify webpages in any way. This vastly improves efficiency because Safari knows in advance what should be blocked. So, with 1Blocker, sites load on average 2-5x faster.\n\nIt’s important to note that not all ads can be blocked though. Some sites use techniques that make it impossible for us to block their ads using currently available features for Safari content blockers.\n\nSECURE BY DESIGN\n\n1Blocker is secure and private. It doesn’t have access to webpages and doesn’t track you in any way.\n\nWe believe that privacy is not for sale. That's why we don't have an \"Acceptable Ads\" program. We stay independent, and the only way we make money is through direct sales of 1Blocker in the App Store to you.\n\nADVANCED CUSTOMIZATION\n\n1Blocker is a highly customizable content blocker, providing the possibility to create powerful custom rules. It allows you to create custom rules that block any URL by providing a regular expression or hide any element by CSS. It also lets you block cookies. (Available in Premium)\n\nAVAILABLE ON ALL DEVICES\n\n1Blocker is available for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Your preferences and custom rules are always in sync through iCloud no matter which device you're using.\n\nFEATURED IN THE PRESS\n\n1Blocker has been featured in TechCrunch, Lifehacker, MacStories, Macworld, and many more.\n\nFEATURES AVAILABLE FOR FREE\n\n• The ability to enable one category (for example, Block Ads only)\n• Whitelisting sites right from the Safari extension\n• Whitelist synchronization between devices via iCloud\n\nFRIENDLY SUPPORT\n\nSend your feedback at @1BlockerApp on Twitter or via email. Your feedback is always very welcome and considered for the next release.\n\n\nWe have been making 1Blocker since 2015. We believe it’s the best all-around package currently available in the App Store.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://1blocker.com/privacy\nTerms of Use: https://1blocker.com/terms", "release_date": "2018-04-26", "last_update": "2025-09-30", "version": "6.3.2", "icon_url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/db/de/13/dbde135e-a6d1-66b7-be68-d4784d9ca3e0/Blocker-AppStore-0-0-1x_U007epad-0-1-0-P3-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg", "scraped_at": "2025-10-03", "iap_count": 0, "iap_min": null, "iap_max": null}

Until you return to the device, you'll be free to engage with what really matters - whether that be getting productive work done, spending time with friends and family, or simply going for a walk.

Designed for simplicity and privacy, Inscreen has minimal features and a zero learning curve, helping you get started quickly.\n\n⏵ HOW IS INSCREEN DIFFERENT?\n\nUnlike other screen time apps that completely block access, Inscreen draws on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) to help you recognize your screen time habits through regular prompts and inculcate healthier behaviours without restrictions.\n\n⏵ WHY IT WORKS?\n\nWe tap into a few key psychological principles and behavioural patterns. Here’s why it works:\n- Awareness = Better Choices: Regular reminders to ask whether you're on your phone intentionally, encouraging healthier choices.\n- Guiding, not controlling: Instead of strict limits, scheduled subtle nudges to guide you toward mindful decisions, without the frustration of restrictions.\n- Accountability: Weekly progress, actionable insights and daily notifications leading to lasting behaviour changes.\n- Low barrier to entry: No drastic changes or restrictions, making it easy to integrate into daily life and gradually adjust over time.\n\n⏵ FEATURES\n\n- Alerts to be intentional about your screen time.\n- Focus sessions to completely block distracting apps for a set routine, say, during work or winding down at night.\n- Strict daily limits to keep your screen time in control.\n- Notifications that help you track your daily activity.\n- Secure and private. All your data stays on your device.\n\n⏵ HOW DOES THE SETUP WORK?\n\n1. Choose the distracting apps or categories.\n2. Set a daily limit.\n3. Set up focus sessions (optional).\n\n⏵ FINANCIAL AID\n\nWe’re on a mission to solve phone addiction and distraction. We’re determined to help everyone. Our Financial Aid program offers a free 1 year subscription to individuals who are financially stretched but are in need.

Every family’s relationship with technology is unique, so we built tools for you to choose the right balance for your family, and help them create healthy digital habits. You can use the app to see how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings, and more.\n\n\nWith Family Link, you can:\n\nEstablish digital ground rules\n• Set screen time limits — Find the screen time that works best for your child. Family Link lets you set daily time limits, with school time and downtime schedules for their devices, so you can help your child find a healthy balance.\n• Manage your child’s apps — Give your child the flexibility they need when it comes to app usage. Set individual app time limits, and unlimited time for educational or regularly used apps. You can block apps, too.\n\nManage content filters and security & privacy\n• Manage what they see online — Set up parental controls on Google services like Chrome, Play, YouTube, and Search. Family Link allows you to block inappropriate sites, require approval for new apps, manage permissions for apps and websites, and more.\n• Secure their account — Family Link gives you access to manage your child’s account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child’s password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel necessary.*\n\n*Children over the applicable age can manage their own account.\n\nStay connected on the go\n• See where they are — It’s helpful to be able to find your family when they’re on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they’re carrying their device.\n• Get notifications and alerts — Family Link delivers critical notifications including when your child arrives or leaves a certain location.  You can also ring devices and view the device’s remaining battery life.\n\n\nImportant Information\n\n• Family Link’s tools vary depending on your child’s device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/\n• While Family Link helps you manage your child’s purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will apply only when your child makes a purchase through Google Play’s billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternate billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.\n• You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.\n• To see the location of your child or teen’s device, the device must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet through data or wifi.\n• Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome, and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.\n• While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the internet safe. Family Link can not determine the content on the internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device, and determine what path to online safety looks best for your family.", "release_date": "2017-04-13", "last_update": "2025-09-29", "version": "2.61.31274", "icon_url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/cd/8b/e1/cd8be174-ec8c-0ddd-933d-398145fbbba3/logo_family_link_color-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-7-0-0-0-85-220-0.png/512x512bb.jpg", "scraped_at": "2025-10-03", "iap_count": 54, "iap_min": 0.0, "iap_max": 0.0}

We've had some tough but productive conversations with our 13-year-old son. It's proving to be extremely valuable.\" — Josh L.\n• “It’s just another set of protections we as parents give our kids for the digital environment (or as my 10-year-old calls it, a “cell phone seat belt”). My oldest is a 9th grader, and while I trust her, I’ve come to realize through the alerts that some of her friends aren’t truly her friends. It’s led to some amazing conversations about choosing friends wisely and recognizing toxic people. While she wasn’t for Bark at first, she’s since said she’s grateful that I saw those messages because it reaffirmed what she was feeling but didn’t know how to verbalize without sounding sensitive.” — Bark Parent\n• \"Bark notified me that my young daughter had unknowingly revealed her phone number to strangers on Twitter. The fact that Bark notified me was impressive and led to an informative discussion with her the same day.\" — Jon B.\n• “Since Bark alerted us to the suicidal language used in the Google doc that was being used in a chat document with a friend, we have seen both a pediatrician and a licensed counselor. We are hopeful for a positive outcome. Thanks to Bark for letting us peek into our child’s mind!” — Bark Parent\n• “This app is a lifesaver! It has allowed us to catch so many “red flags” in the content my kids have accessed on their devices and in their interactions with friends and other people online that I wouldn’t have ever known about otherwise. The big difference between Bark and other “Parental Control” software is that Bark allows your kids to have so much more privacy. It doesn’t show you everything they do, but sends an instant alert regarding any activity that might be concerning. Highly recommended!” — Bark Parent\n\nWith Bark, you can help keep your kids safe both online and in real life.

With a suggested or custom daily time limit, you can teach your child time management while maintaining a healthy screen time balance.\n\nAUTOMATICALLY A SAFE INTERNET\nOver 5 million websites are automatically filtered for you.

Never forget, never procrastinate, never lose sight…\n\n\n\nFocus is not just another tracking tool - it's your companion in navigating adult ADHD.\n\n\n\n\n[WHAT USERS SAY]\n\n\n“ADHD approved\n\nI have tried so many habit tracking apps and this is by far the best one. I love the way it looks (simple, sleek, minimalist, but customizable). It doesn’t overwhelm me looking at it. It also doesn’t send me unnecessary notifications”\n\n\n-Cathryn0404\n\n\n\n“Deleted my other Habit tracker apps\n\n\n\nAside from checking activities off your list, you can classify habits under “Goal” or “Limit”. That got me considering the things I should be cutting down on (like coffee intake).\n\nWhat might be the most interesting aspect is the “Time Tracker” option. I deleted all the other Habit Tracker apps I had on my phone after playing around with this one… this app just seems more motivating.”\n\n\n\n-AliKokua\n\n\n\n“Truly checks all the boxes\n\n\n\nDownload this app immediately. Clean, intuitive interface. Tracks habit building and breaking. Daily task timer. It’s even become my to-do list and reminder app. Can’t speak highly enough of this app and the developer. I had nearly given up.”\n\n\n\n-jajajoshua\n\n\n\n[WHAT THE MEDIA SAYS]\n\n\n\nDigital Journal: “a global habit tracker”\n\n\n\nGQ: “zero distractions and ads”\n\n\n\nYahoo Finance: “habit tracking key player”\n\n\n[HOW FOCUS CAN HELP]\n\n\n\n1. Boost Reading Habits: Distracted easily? Use Focus to increase focus and read more books.\n\n\n2. Enhance Physical Health: Keep track of your workouts and turn sporadic bursts of energy into a regular exercise routine.\n\n\n3. Learn New Skills: ADHD is not a limitation - expand your skillset at your own pace.\n\n\n4. Manage Side Projects: Keep your diverse interests under control, prioritizing and progressing each project effectively.\n\n\n5. Regularize Self-care: From flossing your teeth to meditation - track and maintain those essential routines.\n\n\n6. Habit Formation: Understand where your time goes and create habits tailored to your unique brain.\n\n\n7. Minimize Destructive Habits: Smoke less, reduce alcohol, limit unproductive screen time - use Focus to manage impulsivity.\n\n\n\n[WHY CHOOSE FOCUS FOR ADULT ADHD]\n\n\n\n-> Individual Activity Trackers: Every activity you track is a step towards understanding and managing your ADHD better.\n\n\n-> Visual Progress: Visual cues work wonders with ADHD. Watch your growth with beautifully designed statistics.\n\n\n-> Motivating Reminders & Notifications: Just when you need a nudge, Timecap's reminders can help keep you on track.\n\n\n-> Flexible Timeframes: Set daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly goals and limits - you're in control.\n\n\n\nUnlike other habit trackers, Focus ensures you invest time in what truly matters. Streaks are meaningful and fulfilling. And if one breaks? That's okay - start over and strive to break your personal records.\n\n\n\n[SUBSCRIPTION DETAILS]\n\n\n\nAuto-renewing subscriptions will charge your iTunes account unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

The more you strengthen this connection, the more resilient you’ll be when you experience difficult or challenging circumstances.\n\nAs Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe.

When you focus your energy on the things you want, like achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting, and good, you’re creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen.\n- They open you up to possibility.

The treatment includes Focus Score, a first-of-its-kind personalized metric where you can track attention progress.\n\nEndeavorOTC is for adults 18 years and older with ADHD experiencing inattention-related challenges that affect their quality of life such as diminished focus, inability to complete projects or tasks, keep track of important items, and more. Built with the same technology as EndeavorRx, the world's first FDA-authorized video game treatment. EndeavorOTC is available now by subscription. No prescription needed. \n\nEndeavorOTC was studied in more than 220 participants over a 6-week period. In the clinical trial, 88% of participants saw improvement in their attention and 73% of participants reported quality of life improvements, including an increased ability to balance projects, get things done on time and keep track of important items like phone, wallet, and keys. There were no lasting or serious side effects in any clinical trials for EndeavorOTC. (1,2)\n\nHow EndeavorOTC improves focus: The gameplay challenges you to tap targets and navigate obstacles to boost your attention and focus. As you progress through the game, the technology is continuously measuring your performance and using adaptive algorithms to adjust the difficulty and personalize the treatment experience.\n\nHow to Play EndeavorOTC: Playing EndeavorOTC can fit into your daily routine. The more you play, the better your results.\n\nPlaying the game every day for an initial six weeks can improve your attention and other functions that make up your ability to focus. Users will be given a target Focus Score increase which should be achievable in six weeks. Based on clinical trial data, the target increase provided directly relates to improvement in ADHD-related symptoms and overall quality of life. And, for the vast majority of people, this will leave room for continued improvement in Focus Score and cognitive abilities as well as ADHD symptom management beyond the initial six week course of treatment. \n\nIt is recommended that patients speak to their health care provider before starting EndeavorOTC treatment, and before making any medical decisions. \n\n© 2025 Akili Interactive Labs, Inc.

Using a child-friendly video game (for ages 6-12), Joon helps motivate your child to focus and stay on top of their daily routine, tasks, & habits.\n\n\n**JOON’S GOAL**\n\nHelp motivate your child with ADHD, ASD, ODD, General Anxiety, or Depression to focus and complete their daily tasks while learning basic responsibility and independence. Not only does Joon make it extremely easy to motivate kids to do important tasks using a video game, but it also teaches them valuable life skills that they won’t be able to learn in school. We’ve helped over two hundred thousand families complete more than 1M+ tasks, so why can't we help you?\n\n\n**HOW IT WORKS**\n\nAssign tasks as \"Quests\", then the video game does the rest.\n\n1) Create a few tasks that your child struggles with the most (such as brushing their teeth, getting ready for school, etc.)\n\n2) Your child chooses a virtual pet (called a Doter) to feed, wash, and grow. In order to take care of their pet and play the Joon video game, they must first complete the tasks you've assigned them.\n\n3) Once completed, you will get a notification to review and approve/reject your child's completed tasks. If approved, your child will receive coins to use to care for their pet and unlock different parts of the video game!\n\n4) As your child completes more and more tasks, they will develop habits and improve their daily routine - all because they want to play a video game!\n\n\n**THE PARENTING TOOL YOU NEED**\n\n+ We make it easy to manage your child’s tasks and add in your existing routine.\n\n+ We'll do the reminding to help your child stick to their routine. No more nagging from your end.\n\n+ Your child will stay motivated to do the tasks assigned to them. In fact, 90% of kids on Joon complete all tasks assigned.\n\n+ Choose from a large list of research-backed activities to help your child build important life skills that teach independence.\n\nJoon is only a year old and already has the attention of press, parenting publications, and parenting experts. To see the complete list, visit our website here: https://joonapp.io\n\n\n**HOW TO GET STARTED**\n\n1) Install Joon on your device, create your family, and select a few beginning tasks you’d like your child to work on.\n\n2) Help your child set up their account so they can see the tasks that you’ve assigned them. You can have them download Joon on their own device or share you phone.\n\n3) Once your child completes their tasks, you can review and approve them to make sure they were completed correctly.\n\n4) Once approved, your children receive coins and experience points that let them feed, level up, buy things, and progress in the game with their virtual pet. As your child continues to progress in the game, they actually progress in real life too!\n\n5) Keep adding quests (and we’ll recommend you new ones too) to help your children develop good habits! Your children cannot grow on their own. Make sure to stay involved in the process and keep assigning new quests as needed to allow your children to continue helping, learning, growing, and progressing in the game.\n\n\n**QUESTIONS?**\n\nEmail us at contact@joonapp.io!\n\nWe offer top tier customer support 24/7, 7 days a week, that will respond to your question within 15 minutes.\n\n--------------------\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.joonapp.io/privacy-policy\n\nTerms Of Use: https://www.joonapp.io/terms-of-service", "release_date": "2020-06-23", "last_update": "2025-09-09", "version": "4.79", "icon_url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/9e/54/6a/9e546ad6-5618-242c-5ac9-d2351b623dd0/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-8-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg", "scraped_at": "2025-10-03", "iap_count": 0, "iap_min": null, "iap_max": null}

Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended escape. An escape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your escape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of escapes.

You can also make multiple vision boards!\n\n4. DAILY ZEN\n\nWe understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app.\n\nHere, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.\n\n5. MINDFUL MINUTES\n\nWe define the Mindful minutes as the time that you spend in the Gratitude app. You can view the mindful minutes under 'All Health Data' section in the Health app provided by Apple. Currently, the app does not read any data from the health app. We don't write any data in the health app without your consent. You can turn on the mindful minutes from the profile & settings in the Gratitude app.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.notion.so/Gratitude-App-Privacy-Policy-40195d1e9f51499c82dc8f7d06ab2a1c\nTerms of Use: https://medium.com/@priteshsankhe/terms-and-conditions-c7a676f5d884", "release_date": "2018-04-22", "last_update": "2025-09-23", "version": "5.0.1", "icon_url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/54/6c/75/546c75ff-95a9-bcfb-fc77-152766e46331/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007epad-0-1-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg", "scraped_at": "2025-10-03", "iap_count": 0, "iap_min": null, "iap_max": null}

More than a way to disconnect — it can be a way to feel a part of something bigger. More than simply silence — it can be immersive, beautiful, moving.”\n\n–Raed Khawaja, Open Co-founder & CEO\n\nRegulate your nervous system with Open. Bridge science and spirituality to cleanse your body and mind. Learn breathwork, meditation, and movement techniques designed by experts in neurobiology. Practice on the app and in-person at our flagship studio in Los Angeles. \n\nCLASSES\n\nBREATHE: Since the dawn of civilization, humans have developed techniques for manipulating our breath to induce desired states of consciousness. Now peer-reviewed studies in neuroscience and psychology confirm that breathwork is a powerful toolkit for regulating your nervous system, optimizing your health and well-being, and catalyzing personal transformation. Breathwork is an umbrella term for myriad practices, both ancient and modern. While many techniques are deeply rooted in spiritual traditions like Yoga, Qi Gong, and Buddhism, contemporary applications integrate ancient wisdom with modern science.This synthesis of ancient and modern has given rise to transformational breathwork, designed to induce profound experiences of catharsis, insight, and breakthrough. Experience a mental reset with just a few minutes of conscious breathing.\n\n\nMEDITATE: Train your awareness and contemplate wisdom – with techniques that span generations, cultures, and traditions – with our daily meditations and monthly programs. Learn how to enhance your focus, reduce your stress and anxiety, and regulate your emotions with simple mindfulness techniques you can incorporate into your daily life. \n\n\nMOVE: Our methodology is designed through the intelligence of fitness – blending endurance, strength, mobility, and recovery – with the wisdom of mindfulness. A ritual for resilience, strengthening the body and mind.\n\nANYTIME, ANYWHERE: Practice on your time with our endless library, with fresh classes added daily. From simple 5-minute breathwork techniques, to 60-minute strength and conditioning classes, build your practice to fit your schedule and meet your goals. Whether you’re starting your journey or seeking a new challenge, there are classes for every level and mood.\n\nPROGRESS TRACKING: Create a daily habit that sticks with progress tracking, push reminders, streaks, and badges. A consistent breathwork and meditation practice has proven to reduce cortisol levels and regulate the nervous system–decreasing stress, supporting emotional well-being, and enhancing mental clarity. These techniques can also improve physical health by increasing heart rate variability, promoting cardiovascular health, and boosting immune function.\n\nCONNECT WITH US\n\nQuestions?

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you.

In addition, Declutter The Mind offers 30-day courses that will teach you how to meditate, form the habit of a regular practice, and expand your mind through the teachings of mindfulness meditation.\n\nThis is all without positioning meditation as something mystical, spiritual, or supernatural for it to work for you. The science already shows that a regular meditation practice improves mental health and happiness. Let our app help you unlock these benefits without attaching it to something woo-woo.\n\nDeclutter The Mind offers a practical and easy approach to sitting down and observing the mind. With enough practice, you’ll start to have insights into your mind, how it works, and how busy it is. These insights can make you a calmer, less reactive, and happier person.\n\nWHAT IS MEDITATION\nIf you want to understand the mind, sit down and observe it. Meditation is using a non-judgemental awareness to notice what thoughts, feelings, and sensations appear in consciousness. It’s about becoming aware of just how busy the mind is, and breaking away from that momentum. Buddhists call this the monkey mind, the mind that’s constantly busy and chattering, sometimes without us even fully noticing it. We can call this clutter, and this app will help you declutter the mind.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMeditation doesn’t require any special equipment, or crossing your legs in a particular way, or holding your fingers out. You just need a comfortable and quiet spot where you can remain undisturbed for 10 minutes. Once you’ve found your spot, choose the guided meditation that best suits your needs. If you’re unsure where to start, check out the Essentials category to find meditations for beginners. Choose the session, select your length, and follow the guided instructions.\n\nWHAT’S IN THE APP\n- Several categories of individual guided meditations\n- Courses for new practitioners and experienced meditators\n- A new guided meditation every single day with the Daily Guided Meditation feature\n- 30-day mindfulness course for beginners\n- 10-day loving-kindness course\n- Theory included in each lesson, along with a guided practice\n- Emergency category allowing you quick sessions in times of need\n- Heart your favorites so they’re easy to find and return to later\n- Set a daily reminder to meditate at the time you want with the built-in Push Notification Reminders\n- Meditation timer for unguided meditation\n- Dark mode and light mode\n- Download play offline\n- Different types of meditation: Mindfulness, Vipassana, Loving-Kindness, visualization, body scan\n- Meditation and mindfulness articles to deepen your leaning\n- Guided meditation led by a 15+ year practitioner\n\nTOPICS INCLUDE\n- Mindfulness\n- Body scan\n- Loving-kindness\n- Breathing exercises\n- Anxiety\n- Stress\n- PTSD\n- Depression\n- Sleep\n- Relaxation\n- Focus\n- Concentration and clarity\n- Morning and waking up\n- Energy\n- Cravings\n- Anger\n- Mental health\n- Managing emotions\n\nUPCOMING FEATURES\n- Live guided meditations\n- Track your minutes and time meditating using Mindful Minutes and Apple Health\n- Track stats: total minutes meditated, number of days total meditated\n- Selectable meditation length\n- Group meditation sessions with friends and family\n- Friends list\n- Apple Watch integration\n\nAll guided meditations are free for life.

It helps to reduce stress, promote concentration and increase general well-being. Especially in a hectic world where we are often overwhelmed by obligations and distractions, a meditation app helps to create moments of calm and to arrive in the here and now. \n\nThere is an important connection between meditation apps and the concept of MBSR (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction), a scientifically based method for reducing stress. MBSR uses mindfulness exercises such as meditation, breathing techniques and body scans to manage stress and chronic strain. Many meditation apps are based on similar principles and offer guided exercises that integrate the central elements of MBSR. This allows users to benefit from the proven techniques and integrate mindfulness into their everyday lives - whether to manage stress, improve sleep or promote serenity.\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)", "release_date": "2014-01-16", "last_update": "2025-01-02", "version": "4.1", "icon_url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/7f/4f/98/7f4f984e-a93a-3751-64eb-0c5e26fb0d94/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-8-0-85-220-0.png/512x512bb.jpg", "scraped_at": "2025-10-03", "iap_count": 49, "iap_min": 0.0, "iap_max": 49.99}
